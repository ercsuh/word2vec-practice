32879076|t|Radiomics features of ascending and descending nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
32879076|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the application value of CT-based radiomics features for the ascending and descending types of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: A total of 217 NPC patients (48 ascending type and 169 descending type), who obtained CT images before radiotherapy in Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University from February 2015 to October 2017, were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were randomly divided into a training set (n=153) and a test set (n=64). Gross tumor volume in the nasopharynx (GTVnx) was selected as regions of interest (ROI) and was analyzed by radiomics. A total of 1 300 radiomics features were extracted via IBEX. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was performed to choose the significant features. Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers were built and verified. RESULTS: Six features were selected by the LASSO from 1 300 radiomics features. Compared with SVM classifier, RF classifier showed better classification performance. The area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.989, 0.941, 1.000, and 0.924, respectively for the training set; 0.994, 0.937, 1.000, and 0.924, respectively for the validation set. CONCLUSIONS: CT-based radiomics features possess great potential in differentiating ascending and descending NPC. It provides a certain basis for accurate medical treatment of NPC, and may affect the treatment strategy of NPC in the future.

32882067|t|Multiscale analysis of SRY-positive 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development: Presentation of nine cases.
32882067|a|46,XX testicular disorder of sex development (46,XX TDSD) is a relatively rare condition characterised by the presence of testicular tissue with 46,XX karyotype. The present study aims to reveal the phenotype to genotype correlation in a series of sex-determining region Y (SRY)-positive 46,XX TDSD cases. We present the clinical findings, hormone profiles and genetic test results of six patients with SRY-positive 46,XX TDSD and give the details and follow-up findings of our three of previously published patients. All patients presented common characteristics such as azoospermia, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and an SRY gene translocated on the terminal part of the short arm of one of the X chromosomes. Mean +- standard deviation (SD) height of the patients was 164.78 +- 8.0 cm. Five patients had decreased secondary sexual characteristics, and three patients had gynaecomastia with varying degrees. Five of the seven patients revealed a translocation between protein kinase X (PRKX) and inverted protein kinase Y (PRKY) genes, and the remaining two patients showed a translocation between the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) of X chromosome and the differential region of Y chromosome. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) analysis results demonstrated random and skewed XCI in 5 cases and 1 case, respectively. In brief, we delineate the phenotypic spectrum of patients with SRY-positive 46,XX TDSD and the underlying mechanisms of Xp;Yp translocations.

32885644|t|[Experience of transnazal endoscopic surgery of juvenile angiofibroma of the skull base and nasopharynx without performing preoperative embolization].
32885644|a|Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a hypervascular, blood-supplied, benign tumour affecting the sinuses, nasal cavity, nasopharynx and the base of the skull. For intraoperative hemostasis, pre-operative embolism is a common and recommended procedure, but it has serious disadvantages, such as additional radiation exposure, anesthesia, and the risk of iatrogenic complications associated with the occlusion of the central artery of the retina, orbital and middle cerebral arteries. This article presents a report on successful radical removal of the widespread SAS without resorting to preoperative embolization, but with intraoperative transnazal endoscopic clipping of the internal maxillary artery (IMA).

32895947|t|Opium Use and the Risk of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
32895947|a|Scant evidence exists to support the association of opium use with head and neck cancer, limited to the larynx and oral cavity. In a multicenter case-control study -Iran Opium and Cancer study (IROPICAN), we recruited 633 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (254 lip and oral cavity, 54 pharynx, 327 larynx, and 28 other sub-sites within the head and neck) and 3065 frequency-matched controls from April 2016 to April 2019. Odds ratios (ORs) for opium use and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were obtained using mixed-effects logistic regression because of heterogeneity amongst centers. The adjusted OR (95% CI) for regular opium use was 3.76 (2.96 to 4.79) for all HNSCC combined. Strong dose-response effects were observed by frequency or amount of use, and duration of use. Regular opium uses significantly increased the risk of HNSCC of the pharynx, larynx, and other sub-sites within the head and neck with OR (95% CI) of 2.90 (1.40 to 6.02), 6.55 (4.69 to 9.13), and 5.95 (2.41 to 14.71), respectively. The observed associations were significant even among never tobacco smokers (including cigarette and water-pipe smoking). Moreover, by the multiplicative interaction scale, the effect of opium use could be varied by cigarette smoking on HNSCC, 8.16 (6.20 to 10.74). For the first time, the current study showed opium users have an increased risk of several anatomic sub-sites of HNSCC.

32901905|t|Positive Immunostaining for Succinate Dehydrogenase B (SDHB) in Paraganglioma Associated with Germline Mutation of SDHB, L157X and P236S.
32901905|a|PURPOSE: Pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) associated with the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) germline mutations are characterized by negative results of immunohistochemistry tests for SDH subunit B (SDHB). Genetic testing for the SDH complex (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, and SDHAF2) is indicated only in patients with those diseases in whom immunohistochemistry tests for SDHB as a surrogate marker to detect the SDH complex mutation yield negative results. Two novel SDHB germline mutations, L157X and P236S, in PGL were previously reported. We therefore examined immunohistochemistry testing for SDHB in the PGLs with the SDHB germline mutations of L157X and P236S. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for SDHB was performed in PGLs with the SDHB germline mutations of L157X and P236S. Five cases of sporadic PCC were subject to immunohistochemistry testing for SDHB. Normal tissue from the adrenal cortex adjacent to the sporadic PCC was used as the external positive control. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry results were positive for SDHB in PGLs with the SDHB germline mutation of L157X and P236S, all five cases of sporadic PCC, and the adrenal cortex as the external positive control. CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemistry tests for SDHB showed positivity in PGLs associated with the SDHB germline mutations of L157X and P236S. Thus, immunohistochemistry testing for SDHB might not always reveal a surrogate marker in formal genetic testing of the SDH complex.

32909176|t|Uncommon tumors in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1: Do they have a relationship with the prognosis of these patients?
32909176|a|INTRODUCTION: The prognosis of MEN 1 patients is not only determined by pancreatic disease; it is also related to other uncommon tumors. The objective of this study is to analyze the tumors associated with MEN 1 outside the classic triad and to investigate their relationship with mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and five MEN 1 patients were studied in a tertiary referral hospital (1980-2019). RESULTS: With a follow-up of 11 +- 4 years, seven patients died (8%), four as a consequence MEN syndrome. Thirty-three percent had adrenal gland tumors. One patient died of adrenal cancer. Eight percent presented with a neuroendocrine thoracic neoplasm, and one patient died. Another patient died due to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A further patient died because of a gastrinoma with liver metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, 75% of MEN-related deaths were the result of an uncommon pathology, and we, therefore, recommend that these tumors should be taken into account in the screening and follow-up of these patients.

32920920|t|Efficacy and safety of cold forceps biopsy for diminutive pharyngeal neoplasms: A single-center, prospective pilot study.
32920920|a|BACKGROUND: Management of diminutive pharyngeal neoplasms is controversial. Thus, we conducted a single-center, prospective pilot study to investigate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic excision with cold forceps biopsy (CFB) of these lesions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine lesions endoscopically diagnosed with narrow band imaging as pharyngeal neoplasms of 3 mm or smaller were excised with CFB using jumbo biopsy forceps (cap diameter 2.8 mm; jaw volume 12.4 mm3 ). The primary outcome was endoscopically determined local remnant/recurrence rate 3 months after CFB. The secondary outcomes were histopathologically determined local remnant/recurrence rate; risk factors associated with the endoscopic remnant/recurrence; and incidence of intraoperative or delayed bleeding and other adverse events. RESULTS: Histological diagnosis of the 39 CFB-excised lesions were: 11 high-grade dysplasia (28.2%), 22 low-grade dysplasia (56.4%), 2 basal cell hyperplasia (5.1%) and 4 atypical squamous epithelium (10.3%).Twenty-seven patients (30 lesions) underwent follow-up endoscopy 3 months after CFB; the endoscopic and pathological local remnant/recurrence rate was 20% (6/30; 95% confidence interval, 7.7-36.6%) and 16.7% (5/30; 5.6-34.7%), respectively. Location of the lesion in the hypopharynx was a significant risk factor associated with the endoscopic local remnant/recurrence (p = 0.049). No significant adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: CFB with jumbo biopsy forceps appears to be a safe and effective technique for excising diminutive pharyngeal neoplasms. Although small, the excised lesions may have a remarkably high frequency of high-grade dysplasia. (Clinical trial registration number: UMIN000037980).

32928232|t|Identification of miPEP133 as a novel tumor-suppressor microprotein encoded by miR-34a pri-miRNA.
32928232|a|BACKGROUND: Very few proteins encoded by the presumed non-coding RNA transcripts have been identified. Their cellular functions remain largely unknown. This study identifies the tumor-suppressor function of a novel microprotein encoded by the precursor of miR-34a. It consists of 133 amino acid residues, thereby named as miPEP133 (pri-microRNA encoded peptide 133). METHODS: We overexpressed miPEP133 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), ovarian cancer and cervical cancer cell lines to determine its effects on cell growth, apoptosis, migration, or invasion. Its impact on tumor growth was evaluated in a xenograft NPC model. Its prognostic value was analyzed using NPC clinical samples. We also conducted western blot, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry to determine the underlying mechanisms of miPEP133 function and regulation. RESULTS: miPEP133 was expressed in normal human colon, stomach, ovary, uterus and pharynx. It was downregulated in cancer cell lines and tumors. miPEP133 overexpression induced apoptosis in cancer cells and inhibited their migration and invasion. miPEP133 inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Low miPEP133 expression was an unfavorable prognostic marker associated with advanced metastatic NPC. Wild-type p53 but not mutant p53 induced miPEP133 expression. miPEP133 enhanced p53 transcriptional activation and miR-34a expression. miPEP133 localized in the mitochondria to interact with mitochondrial heat shock protein 70kD (HSPA9) and prevent HSPA9 from interacting with its binding partners, leading to the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial mass. CONCLUSION: miPEP133 is a tumor suppressor localized in the mitochondria. It is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for multiple types of cancers.

32944530|t|The efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate in patients with high-risk prostate cancer: a meta-analysis based on six randomized control trials.
32944530|a|Background: Abiraterone acetate, a CYP17 enzyme inhibitor, can block the synthesis of androgens in the adrenal gland, prostate, and testis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate in high-risk prostate cancer patients, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). Methods: A meta-analysis based on 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was undertaken in compliance with the guidelines of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library were searched for relevant literature through to September 2019. Results: The pooled analysis reported abiraterone acetate showed significant efficacy in high-risk prostate cancer patients, including overall survival (OS) [HR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.73, P<0.001], the time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (HR 0.45, 95% CI, 0.34-0.59, P<0.001), progression-free survival (PFS) (according to radiographic evidence) (HR 0.55, 95% CI, 0.45-0.68, P<0.001) and PSA response rate (RR 2.49, 95% CI, 1.47-4.22, P<0.001). A subgroup analysis was carried out due to the significant heterogeneity between the studies. The incidence of arthralgia (RR 1.19), hypokalemia (RR 2.47), cardiac disorder (RR 1.48), and hypertension (RR 1.57) in the abiraterone acetate group was moderately higher than the control group. Conclusions: The efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate as an androgen receptor (AR) pathway targeted drug in high-risk prostate cancer patients was confirmed.

32944537|t|Deep vein thrombosis in a nonobstructive azoospermia male taking tamoxifen: a rare case report.
32944537|a|Tamoxifen is used for male infertility and nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Although thrombosis complication of tamoxifen on the treatment of breast cancer has been reported repeatedly, there was no literature about the thrombosis complication of tamoxifen treatment on NOA. A 32-year-old man was admitted to hospital for severe swelling of left lower limb, with difficulty walking. He had been diagnosed with NOA 5 months ago and had been taking tamoxifen 20 mg daily for 4 months continuously. After admission, the patient was finally diagnosed of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with elevated D-dimer level and Doppler ultrasound of the deep venous system. After a series of effective treatments, especially the operation of percutaneous venous thromboembolism aspiration, the patient recovered rapidly and the abnormal laboratory results of coagulopathy returned to normal. Clinicians should warn about the possibility of thromboembolic complications with tamoxifen when treating male infertility.

32957011|t|Tobacco-related cancers in Europe: The scale of the epidemic in 2018.
32957011|a|BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is the major preventable cause of cancer. Despite the longstanding decline in smoking prevalence, lung cancer remains one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in both sexes. We aimed to estimate the current cancer burden attributable to smoking in Europe. METHODS: Smoking-related cancer incidence by country, cancer type, sex and age in Europe was estimated from GLOBOCAN 2018. We applied a modified version of the indirect method to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) for lung cancer and applied Levin's formula to estimate the PAF for other smoking-related cancer sites. RESULTS: In Europe in 2018, 572,000 and 186,000 cancer cases were attributable to tobacco smoking in males and females respectively, accounting for 28% (males) and 10% (females) of all cancer cases. By region, the largest and the lowest PAF due to smoking in males occurred in Eastern Europe (35% of all cancer cases) and Northern Europe (21%), respectively. Among women, this pattern was reversed (16% in Northern Europe and 6% in Eastern Europe). Lung cancer accounted for more than half of the total cancer burden attributable to smoking (382,000). Other major contributors to the total PAF were lip, oral cavity and pharynx, bladder and laryngeal cancers in men (27% out of total PAF) and colorectal, pancreatic, oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers (21%) in women. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco smoking was responsible for one in five cancer cases in Europe in 2018. The introduction and robust implementation of tobacco control programmes are critical to reduce this cancer burden in the future.

32962040|t|Cracd Marks the First Wave of Meiosis during Spermatogenesis and Is Mis-Expressed in Azoospermia Mice.
32962040|a|Testicular development starts in utero and maturation continues postnatally, requiring a cascade of gene activation and differentiation into different cell types, with each cell type having its own specific function. As we had previously reported that the Capping protein inhibiting regulator of actin (Cracd) gene was expressed in the adult mouse testis, herein we examine when and where the beta-catenin associated Cracd is initially expressed during postnatal testis development. Significantly, Cracd mRNA is present in both the immature postnatal and adult testis in round spermatid cells, with highest level of expression occurring during the first wave of meiosis and spermatogenesis. In the juvenile testes, Cracd is initially expressed within the innermost region but as maturation occurs, Cracd mRNA switches to a more peripheral location. Thereafter, Cracd is downregulated to maintenance levels in the haploid male germ cell lineage. As Cracd mRNA was expressed within developing round spermatids, we tested its effectiveness as a biomarker of non-obstructive azoospermia using transgenic knockout mice models. Meaningfully, Cracd expression was absent in Deleted in azoospermia like (Dazl) null testis, which exhibit a dramatic germ cell loss. Moreover, Cracd was abnormally regulated and ectopically mis-expressed in Polypyrimidine tract binding protein-2 (Ptbp2) conditional germ cell restricted knockout testis, which exhibit a block during spermatid differentiation and a reduction in the number of late stage spermatocytes coincident with reduced beta-catenin expression. Combined, these data suggest that Cracd is a useful first wave of spermatogenesis biomarker of azoospermia phenotypes, even prior to an overt phenotype being evident.

32966799|t|11q Deletion or ALK Activity Curbs DLG2 Expression to Maintain an Undifferentiated State in Neuroblastoma.
32966799|a|High-risk neuroblastomas typically display an undifferentiated or poorly differentiated morphology. It is therefore vital to understand molecular mechanisms that block the differentiation process. We identify an important role for oncogenic ALK-ERK1/2-SP1 signaling in the maintenance of undifferentiated neural crest-derived progenitors through the repression of DLG2, a candidate tumor suppressor gene in neuroblastoma. DLG2 is expressed in the murine "bridge signature" that represents the transcriptional transition state when neural crest cells or Schwann cell precursors differentiate to chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland. We show that the restoration of DLG2 expression spontaneously drives neuroblastoma cell differentiation, highlighting the importance of DLG2 in this process. These findings are supported by genetic analyses of high-risk 11q deletion neuroblastomas, which identified genetic lesions in the DLG2 gene. Our data also suggest that further exploration of other bridge genes may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of NC-derived progenitors and their contribution to neuroblastomas.

32967703|t|TMPRSS2, a SARS-CoV-2 internalization protease is downregulated in head and neck cancer patients.
32967703|a|BACKGROUND: SARS-coronavirus-2 enters host cells through binding of the Spike protein to ACE2 receptor and subsequent S priming by the TMPRSS2 protease. We aim to assess differences in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in normal tissues from oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and lung tissues as well as neoplastic tissues from the same areas. METHODS: The study has been conducted using the TCGA and the Regina Elena Institute databases and validated by experimental model in HNSCC cells. We also included data from one COVID19 patient who went under surgery for HNSCC. RESULTS: TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues. It was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors, in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we modeled the multivariate effect of TP53, HPV, and other inherent variables on TMPRSS2. All variables had a statistically significant independent effect on TMPRSS2. In particular, in tumor tissues, HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes were associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. The further analysis of both TCGA and our institutional HNSCC datasets identified a signature anti-correlated to TMPRSS2. As proof-of-principle we also validated the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient tissues Finally, we did not find TMPRSS2 promoter methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. These observations may help to better assess the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.

32971447|t|Achalasia in a woman presenting with vitiligo: A case report.
32971447|a|BACKGROUND: Achalasia is a rare motor disorder of the oesophagus that typically characterized by the absence of oesophagus peristalsis and failure of swallow induced relaxation of oesophagus sphincter (LOS). The prevalence of achalasia is eight cases per million population. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 35-year-old woman presented with progressive dysphagia for 6 years. Her symptoms worsened in the last 14 days followed by vomiting undigested and retained food. She was previously diagnosed with a variant respiratory problem but her symptoms did not improve with medication. Clinical evaluation and investigation revealed features of multiple depigmented patches with sharply defined borders and leucotrichia on the neck, abdomen, hand, knee, and lateral malleolus. The patient had vitiligo for 18 years. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed the dilatation from distal oesophagus (38 cm from incisors) with retained food. The diagnosis of achalasia was given. After laparoscopic Heller's myotomy was performed and the opening of the oesophagus was repaired with Dor's fundoplication, her symptoms were much improved. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We hereby report on a rare case of achalasia in a woman presenting with vitiligo which may suggest an autoimmune disorder in the onset of achalasia. Achalasia must be considered in vitiligo or any autoimmune disease presenting with the oesophagus-related problem.

32973638|t|Videoconferencing Psychotherapy for Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia: Outcome and Treatment Processes From a Non-randomized Non-inferiority Trial.
32973638|a|Background: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislations are being modified around the world to allow patients to receive mental health services through telehealth. Unfortunately, there are no large clinical trial available to reliably document the efficacy of delivering videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP) for people with panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) and whether basic psychotherapeutic processes are altered. Methods: This 2-arm intent-to-treat non-inferiority study reports on a clinical trial on VCP and documents how therapeutic working alliance and motivation toward psychotherapy are associated to treatment outcome. We hypothesized that VCP would not be inferior to standard face-to-face (FF) cognitive behavior therapy for PDA. No specific hypothesis was stated to address working alliance and treatment mechanisms. VCP was compared to a gold-standard psychotherapy treatment for PDA, which was delivered either in person or in videoconference, with a strict tolerance criterion of about 2 points on the primary outcome measure. Seventy one adult patients were recruited. Measures of working alliance were collected after the first, fifth, and last session. Motivation toward therapy at pre-treatment and working alliance after the fifth therapy session were used as predictors of treatment outcome and compared with change in dysfunctional beliefs toward bodily sensations. Results: Panic disorder, agoraphobia, fear of sensations and depressed mood all showed significant improvements and large effect-sizes from pre to post-treatment. Gains were maintained at follow-up. No significant differences were found between VCP and FF, and effect sizes were trivial for three of the four outcome measures. Non-inferiority tests confirmed that VCP was no less effective than FF therapy on the primary outcome measure and two of the three secondary outcome measures. Working alliance was very strong in VCP and did not statistically differ from FF. Working alliance and motivation did not predict treatment outcome, which was significantly predicted by the reduction in dysfunctional beliefs. The strength of the therapeutic bond was correlated with change in dysfunctional beliefs. Conclusion: Mental health professionals can use VCP to provide services to patients with PDA. Building and maintaining a sound working alliance should not be a source concern. Practical recommendations are formulated. ISRCTN Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN76456442.

32973676|t|Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in Specific Genetic Syndromes in Childhood and Adolescence.
32973676|a|Autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) is the most frequent cause of acquired thyroid dysfunction, most commonly presenting either as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' Disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized by the presence of thyroid-specific autoantibodies, more commonly anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies in the serum and the typical inhomogeneous echostructure of the thyroid on a thyroid ultrasound examination. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can for a long time be accompanied by normal thyroid function and hypothyroidism can only progressively be established. Graves' disease is much less frequent in childhood and adolescence and presents with overt hyperthyroidism. After the onset of puberty, ATD affects females with a higher incidence than males, while during the prepubertal period there is not such a clear preponderance of affected females. ATD can occur either isolated or in the context of other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1D), celiac disease, alopecia areata, vitiligo, etc. Especially at the pediatric age, a higher incidence of ATD is also observed in the context of specific genetic syndromes, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Nevertheless, although thyroid dysfunction may also be observed in other genetic syndromes, such as Prader-Willi or Williams syndrome, the thyroid dysfunction in these syndromes is not the result of thyroid autoimmunity. Interestingly, there is emerging evidence supporting a possible link between autoimmunity and RASopathies. In this review article the incidence, as well as the clinical manifestation and accompanied pathologies of ATD in specific genetic syndromes will be presented and regular follow-up for the early identification of the disorder will be proposed.

32974361|t|Melanoma Inhibitory Activity (MIA) Is Able to Induce Vitiligo-Like Depigmentation in an in vivo Mouse Model by Direct Injection in the Tail.
32974361|a|In the complex pathogenesis of vitiligo, the exact mechanism of the dermatosis is still to be clarified. We previously demonstrated that a protein called melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is present in non-segmental vitiligo skin and seems to cause the detachment of melanocytes, consequently creating the depigmented macules. In this study, we present an animal model of vitiligo on the basis of the ability of the MIA protein to induce vitiligo-like lesions. Twenty pigmented mice were chosen for the experiments and received injections in the tail with saline (control group) or with saline + MIA protein (treated group). The control group did not show any sign of depigmentation. The treated group showed, instead, clear zones of complete depigmentation in the injected areas in each mouse, with the appearance of white patches with whitening of the hair and a clear-cut edge. Histological examination of the tail in the treated zone showed the absence of melanocytes, without the presence of any inflammatory cell or any sign of skin inflammation patterns, confirming the detachment of the melanocyte operated by the MIA protein. These data seem to confirm a possible role played by the MIA protein in the pathogenesis of vitiligo and may support the development of treatments able to inhibit its action as an alternative therapeutic strategy for this disorder.

32982652|t|Local Treatment in Addition to Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor-Positive and HER2-Negative Oligometastatic Breast Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Multicenter Analysis.
32982652|a|Background: Recent trials have provided robust evidence demonstrating that endocrine therapy with/without targeted therapy, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors or mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors, effectively halts disease progression in hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer. We investigated the survival impact of local treatment of metastases as a first-line treatment after metastasis in HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer patients with a very low metastatic volume. Materials and Methods: From a retrospectively constructed database for three institutes, we identified HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer patients with recurrent distant oligometastatic disease after initially curative treatment. De novo stage 4 patients were excluded, and only those with recurrent metastatic disease were included. Oligometastatic disease was defined as follows: (1) <=2 metastatic lesions in a single organ, (2) a maximal diameter <=3 cm, and (3) organ involvement, including the lung, liver, adrenal gland, bone, or distant lymph nodes. Local treatment comprised surgery or radiotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were investigated. Results: Forty-nine patients were included; 33 underwent local treatment. Of these 33 patients, 5 underwent surgical resection and 27 received radiotherapy. One patient underwent both surgical resection and radiotherapy. Median PFS was significantly longer among the patients with local treatment than among the patients without local treatment (30.0 vs. 18.0 months, p = 0.049). In multivariate analysis, local treatment was shown to prolong PFS. However, median OS after metastasis did not differ with regard to local treatment (72.3 vs. 91.0 months, p = 0.272). Conclusion: We showed that local treatment could positively affect disease progression in HR-positive and HER2-negative oligometastatic breast cancer.

32988142|t|[Clinical characteristics of primary aldosteronism with concurrent adrenal Cushing's syndrome].
32988142|a|Objective: To analyze and summarize the clinical characteristics of primary aldosteronism (PA) with concurrent adrenal Cushing's syndrome (ACS). Methods: The clinical, imaging and pathological data of 87 patients with PA admitted to Peking University First Hospital from January 1st, 2013 to December 31th, 2016 were reviewed. There were 45 males (51.7%) and 42 females (48.3%) with an average age of (52.7+-10.5) years (range: 15-70 years). According to whether they were diagnosed with ACS, the patients were divided into PA with concurrent ACS group (n=11) and pure PA group (n=55). The clinical characteristics of PA with concurrent ACS were summarized. Results: Ten of the eleven patients in PA with concurrent ACS group were diagnosed with subclinical ACS. Compared with these in pure PA group, the patients in PA with concurrent ACS group were older [(55.6+-9.1) years vs (48.4+-10.2) years, P=0.033], with larger diameters of adrenal tumors [(2.3+-1.6) cm vs (1.4+-0.6) cm, P=0.015], higher serum cortisol levels in the circadian rhythm [158 (92, 217) nmol/L vs 71 (43, 128) nmol/L at 0:00, P=0.004], lower plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels in the circadian rhythm [0.80 (<0.22, 1.45) pmol/L vs 4.40 (2.58, 5.93) pmol/L at 8:00, P<0.001; 0.25 (<0.22, 0.91) pmol/L vs 2.03 (0.74, 3.69) pmol/L at 16:00, P<0.001;<0.22 (<0.22, 0.44) pmol/L vs 1.27 (<0.22, 2.66) pmol/L at 0:00, P<0.001], and higher serum cortisol levels after 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test [95 (73, 142) nmol/L vs 30 (22, 41) nmol/L, P<0.001]. Unilateral adrenalectomy was performed in 31 patients, of whom 3 patients in PA with concurrent ACS group (3/8) and 3 patients in pure PA group (3/23) presented with adrenal insufficiency and received glucocorticoid replacement therapy after adrenalectomy. Conclusions: PA with concurrent ACS is not rare in PA patients, which are mainly complicated with subclinical ACS and easily misdiagnosed. It is recommended that elderly PA patients with large adrenal tumors should be screened for ACS by means of cortisol and ACTH circadian rhythm and 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. Postoperative adrenal insufficiency is prone to occur in those patients, who should be followed up closely after adrenalectomy, and receive glucocorticoid replacement therapy in time.

32988143|t|[Clinical features and outcomes of surgical versus conservative management in patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome].
32988143|a|Objective: To examine the clinical characteristics and metabolic features of subclinical Cushing's syndrome (SCS), and determine the effects of surgical or conservative approaches on the hormone levels and metabolic comorbidities in patients with SCS, thereby providing the evidence for decision-making in SCS management. Methods: A total of 56 consecutive SCS patients were selected in Drum Tower Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University Medical School between 2010 and 2018, with 41 patients undergoing surgical treatment and 15 patients receiving conservative therapy. Meanwhile, 56 and 68 cases of sex-and age-matched patients diagnosed as nonfunctional adrenal adenoma (NFA) and adrenal Cushing's syndrome (CS) were included respectively. Clinical characteristics of patients in different groups were compared. Hormone levels and metabolic comorbidities were also observed during follow-up. Results: There were 56 SCS patients, including 15 males and 41 females, with an age of (52.0+-12.6) years. The circadian rhythms of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol disappeared in CS and SCS groups. Compared to NFA group, patients with SCS were characterized by suppressed plasma ACTH level [2.40 (1.11, 4.33) pmol/L vs 4.23 (2.74, 6.26) pmol/L], elevated midnight cortisol level [(240+-121) nmol/L vs (59+-8) nmol/L] and increased cortisol level after 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test [(241+-130) nmol/L vs (34+-12) nmol/L] (all P<0.01). The derangement of ACTH-cortisol axis was more obvious in CS patients compared to SCS patients. The prevalence of hypertension, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and osteopenia/osteoporosis were higher in SCS patients compared to NFA patients (75.0% vs 41.1%, 33.9% vs 12.5%, 62.5% vs 28.6%, 35.7% vs 8.9%, all P<0.05). The 24-hour urine free cortisol correlated positively with systolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose in SCS patients (r=0.335, 0.562 and 0.463, respectively, all P<0.05). In the surgical group, body weight, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure decreased significantly after surgery (all P<0.05). Glucose intolerance/diabetes mellitus improved in 6 of 9 patients, BMI of 4 of 11 overweight/obesity patients normalized, and hypertension in 54.5% of patients (12/22) showed improvement after surgery. However, no alterations of hormone levels and metabolic parameters were observed in conservatively-managed patients. Conclusions: Patients with SCS are characterized by mild autonomous cortisol secretion and increased risk of metabolic comorbidities. Compared with conservative management, hormone abnormalities were corrected and metabolic abnormalities were improved in some SCS patients after surgery.

32988789|t|Adrenal gland fine needle aspiration: a multi-institutional analysis of 139 cases.
32988789|a|INTRODUCTION: Adrenal gland lesions span a range of entities from benign and malignant primary neoplasms to metastatic tumors. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provides a minimally invasive diagnostic tool to stage patients with known malignancy and procure material for molecular testing. This study characterizes the clinicopathologic associations of patients with adrenal gland FNA from 2 large hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FNAs were identified by query of electronic medical record from 2002-2019. Clinical and pathological information was collated and correlated with corresponding surgical diagnosis when available. RESULTS: Of 139 cases, the majority (n = 127, 91%) were adequate computed tomography-guided FNAs and included the following diagnoses: positive for malignancy (n = 77, 55%), negative for malignancy (n = 32, 23%), neoplastic cells present (n = 16, 12%), nondiagnostic (n = 12, 9%), atypical (n = 1, 1%), and suspicious for carcinoma (n = 1, 1%). The majority (94%, n = 72 of 77) of malignancies were metastatic tumors, most frequently carcinoma (n = 53 of 72, 74%), followed by melanoma (n = 11 of 72, 15%), lymphoma (n = 4 of 72, 6%), and sarcoma (n = 4 of 72, 6%). Metastatic carcinomas included lung (n = 21 of 72, 29%), genitourinary (n = 12 of 72, 17%), and hepatobiliary or gastrointestinal tract (n = 11 of 72, 15%) primaries. Primary adrenal neoplasms (n = 23) included adenomas (n = 11 of 23, 48%), pheochromocytomas (n = 4 of 23, 17%), and myelolipomas (n = 3 of 23, 13%). Thirty-two patients with metastases died of disease after median follow-up of 8 months. CONCLUSIONS: High specimen adequacy (n = 127, 91%) and low indeterminate rates (n = 2, 2%) are achieved with adrenal FNA. Most aspirated lesions represent metastases from primary lung carcinomas, but other primary sites including those below the diaphragm are part of the diagnostic differential. Adrenal metastasis was associated with a poor prognosis, with median survival of 8 months.

32988925|t|A Rare Case of Locally Advanced Primary Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Adrenal Gland.
32988925|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) of the adrenal gland is extremely rare with limited reports in the literature. There remain no definitive treatment guidelines, largely due to the rarity of the malignancy. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 62-year-old Caucasian male who presented with low back pain and was found to have a large retroperitoneal mass arising from the left adrenal gland, measuring 18.3 x 12.2 centimeters (cm). Biopsy was consistent with small cell carcinoma/high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma. Staging workup including CT chest and bone scan was negative. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery; complete pathological response of the left adrenal tumor was achieved. Surveillance imaging every three months continued to show no evidence of recurrent disease. CONCLUSION: Primary SCNEC of the adrenal gland is rare and lacks standard treatment guidelines. Our case represents a possible treatment approach that may provide better clinical outcomes, however, further investigations are necessary to help define ideal treatment guidelines.

32989552|t|Phase I, first-in-human trial of programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, JTX-4014, in adult patients with advanced, refractory, solid tumors.
32989552|a|BACKGROUND: Inhibition of programmed cell death receptor protein-1 (PD-1) has proven to be a highly effective strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. Approvals of both PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors [PD-(L)1i] in multiple tumor types are evidence of the durable benefits they provide to patients with cancer. In this first-in-human trial, we assessed the safety and tolerability of JTX-4014, a fully human antibody targeting PD-1. METHODS: JTX-4014 was administered to 18 patients with multiple solid tumor types who had not previously received a PD-(L)1i. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JTX-4014 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives included evaluation of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of JTX-4014, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against JTX-4014, and clinical activity. RESULTS: JTX-4014 was well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified as compared with other PD-1is. The MTD was not reached and the RP2D was selected, based on PK modelling and supportive safety data, to be 500 mg every 3 weeks or 1000 mg every 6 weeks. Clinical activity, based on RECIST v1.1 criteria, demonstrated an overall response rate of 16.7% (n = 3) with one complete and two partial responses and a disease control rate of 44.4% (n = 8). The responses occurred at different doses in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors and in tumor types that are not typically PD-1i responsive. CONCLUSIONS: Further development of JTX-4014 is warranted as a monotherapy or in combination with other innovative cancer therapies. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03790488, December 31 2018.

32992010|t|Report of two cases of lepromatous leprosy at an early age.
32992010|a|Leprosy is an infectious disease that has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Lepromatous leprosy has a deficient cellular immune response and high bacillary multiplication. It has epidemiological importance, as it is the most contagious clinical form of the disease. Its manifestation in children and adolescents is unusual. In the present study, we report two cases of leprosy at an early age, manifesting with the lepromatous clinical form, highlighting the articular involvement in one case. Early diagnosis is an essential tool to avoid deformities and deficiencies.

32992956|t|Computational Study of C-X-C Chemokine Receptor (CXCR)3 Binding with Its Natural Agonists Chemokine (C-X-C Motif) Ligand (CXCL)9, 10 and 11 and with Synthetic Antagonists: Insights of Receptor Activation towards Drug Design for Vitiligo.
32992956|a|Vitiligo is a hypopigmentary skin pathology resulting from the death of melanocytes due to the activity of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes and overexpression of chemokines. These include CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 and its receptor CXCR3, both in peripheral cells of the immune system and in the skin of patients diagnosed with vitiligo. The three-dimensional structure of CXCR3 and CXCL9 has not been reported experimentally; thus, homology modeling and molecular dynamics could be useful for the study of this chemotaxis-promoter axis. In this work, a homology model of CXCR3 and CXCL9 and the structure of the CXCR3/Galphai/0betagamma complex with post-translational modifications of CXCR3 are reported for the study of the interaction of chemokines with CXCR3 through all-atom (AA-MD) and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. AA-MD and CG-MD simulations showed the first activation step of the CXCR3 receptor with all chemokines and the second activation step in the CXCR3-CXCL10 complex through a decrease in the distance between the chemokine and the transmembrane region of CXCR3 and the separation of the betagamma complex from the alpha subunit in the G-protein. Additionally, a general protein-ligand interaction model was calculated, based on known antagonists binding to CXCR3. These results contribute to understanding the activation mechanism of CXCR3 and the design of new molecules that inhibit chemokine binding or antagonize the receptor, provoking a decrease of chemotaxis caused by the CXCR3/chemokines axis.

32994366|a|A 67-year-old Brazilian man of African ancestry and his 60-year-old sister both presented with choreiform movements, although in the man these were significantly overshadowed by additional parkinsonism. The man also had a history of four epileptic seizures. Neurological examination in each also found slow saccades and a dysexecutive syndrome. Genetic tests for Huntington's disease were negative but were positive for Huntington's disease-like 2. There are various genetic causes of chorea diseases, and their correct identification is important for appropriate clinical management and genetic counselling.

32994931|t|Cysteine and homocysteine as biomarker of various diseases.
32994931|a|Cysteine and homocysteine (Hcy), both sulfur-containing amino acids (AAs), produced from methionine another sulfur-containing amino acid, which is converted to Hcy and further converted to cysteine. This article aims to highlight the link between cysteine and Hcy, and their mechanisms, important functions, play in the body and their role as a biomarker for various types of diseases. So that using cysteine and Hcy as a biomarker, we can prevent and diagnose many diseases. This review concluded that hyperhomocysteinemia (elevated levels of homocysteine) is considered as toxic for cells and is associated with different health problems. Hyperhomocysteinemia and low levels of cysteine associated with various diseases like cardiovascular diseases (CVD), ischemic stroke, neurological disorders, diabetes, cancer like lung and colorectal cancer, renal dysfunction-linked conditions, and vitiligo.

32997006|t|Epidemiological trends of leprosy in Goias, Brasil.
32997006|a|Brazil is the second nation in absolute number of new cases of leprosy in the world. The country presents many regions highly endemic to the disease, as is the case of the Goias. The present study aims to analyze the temporal trends of leprosy indicators in Goias between 2006 and 2015. This study showed a significant trend of decline for the coefficient of detection. Although the central-western region of the state presented the highest absolute number of cases, the Northeast of the state presents the worst epidemiological situation, with an increase in the number of cases of patients with physical disabilities and those under 14 years of age. The data also showed that there is an increase in the cases of patients with physical deformities in almost all macroregions of the state, indicative of late diagnosis. It is very important that there is a more effective and continuous training of the health professionals of the non-centralized units, for a real control of leprosy as a public health problem in the state. In addition, special attention should be given to the poorer regions of the state, which have shown a tendency to increase the diagnosis of patients younger than 14 years and with physical disabilities caused by leprosy.

32997007|t|[Prevention of physical disabilities due to leprosy in Brazil: a historic analysis].
32997007|a|Guidelines for the prevention of physical disabilities due to leprosy have been gaining prominence in the control of the disease over and above multidrug therapy. The scope of this study is to describe the chronological changes in the technical guidelines for the prevention of physical disabilities due to leprosy in Brazil. It is a historical account based on official documents of the Brazilian health agencies. All the decrees, ordinances and manuals that mentioned assessment and prevention of disabilities published between 1962 and 2016 were included. The documents established the clinical, technical, welfare, emotional and social criteria that governed preventive actions in health institutions. The publications were coordinated by the Ministry of Health and adapted over the years from a conceptual, political, strategic and welfare standpoint. The guidelines mainly encompassed the activities of neurological assessment and the degree of physical incapacity, techniques of prevention of incapacities and self-care. Physical disabilities reflect the quality of access to diagnosis, monitoring of cases during treatment and post-discharge due to cure. The health services should be organized not only for the diagnosis and provision of multidrug therapy, but for all aspects involving the disease.

32997837|t|Increased level of cathelicidin (LL-37) in vitiligo: Possible pathway independent from vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism.
32997837|a|Vitiligo is a multifactorial skin disease with established role of genetics and autoimmunity in its pathogenesis. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms have been suggested to correlate with risk of vitiligo in some ethnic populations. On the other hand, cathelicidin, one of the innate immune system components, has a role in development of some chronic skin diseases and VDR regulates the expression of cathelicidin. We aimed to determine the plasma level of cathelicidin and its association with the VDR gene polymorphisms as well as plasma vitamin D level in patients with vitiligo. Ninety vitiligo patients and 90 non-vitiligo controls participated in this study. Blood levels of 25(OH) vitamin D and cathelicidin were determined with ELISA. Genotyping for VDR polymorphisms (ApaI, TaqI, FokI and BsmI) was done with RFLP-PCR method. Mean blood level of cathelicidin was significantly higher in vitiligo patients as compared to controls (P<0.0001). Mean blood level of vitamin D was significantly lower in patients than controls (P=0.01). Statistically significant differences were not observed for both genotype and allele frequencies of BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI polymorphisms. There was a borderline increased risk of vitiligo in over-dominant model of FokI polymorphism with OR=1.8 and P=0.051. Our findings are suggestive of the potential role of cathelicidin in the pathogenesis of vitiligo; however, future evaluations are needed to determine precise mechanism. Genetic study of VDR polymorphism was suggestive of increased risk of vitiligo in association with a FokI polymorphism in the VDR gene in Iranian population.

32998662|t|Depression and mental wellbeing in people affected by leprosy in southern Nepal.
32998662|a|BACKGROUND: Leprosy, a leading cause of disability, remains endemic in southern Nepal. Alongside physical impairment and stigmatization, many people affected by leprosy suffer from mental health problems. OBJECTIVES: This study had two objectives: (a) Establishing a baseline level of mental wellbeing and depression among people affected by leprosy in southern Nepal, and (b) Examining factors that influence mental wellbeing and depression in this target group. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using three interview-administered questionnaires measuring level of depression (PHQ-9), mental wellbeing status (WEMWBS) and level of stigma (5-QSI-AP). Random clustering sampling was used to include leprosy-affected people from Self Help Groups (SHGs) and the reference group was matched based on socio-demographic characteristics. All participants were adults with no additional major morbidities. A sample of 142 persons affected by leprosy and 54 community controls were included. RESULTS: People affected by leprosy participating in SHGs had a significantly lower level of mental wellbeing and higher level of depression than the general population. Both mental wellbeing and depression were influenced by gender and the level of stigma. In addition, the level of depression was associated with the disability grade of leprosy-affected people. CONCLUSION: Leprosy-affected people need mental health-care interventions at different organizational levels, with attention to identifying individuals at increased risk for mental health problems or with additional needs. These findings highlight the demand for further research on specific interventions to improve the mental health of leprosy-affected people.

32998998|t|Transient activation of the Hedgehog-Gli pathway rescues radiotherapy-induced dry mouth via recovering salivary gland resident macrophages.
32998998|a|Irreversible hypofunction of salivary glands is a common side effect of radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer and is difficult to remedy. Recent studies indicate that transient activation of Hedgehog signaling rescues irradiation-impaired salivary function in animal models, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. Here we show in mice that activation of canonical Gli-dependent Hedgehog signaling by Gli1 gene transfer is sufficient to recover salivary function impaired by irradiation. Salivary gland cells responsive to Hedgehog/Gli signaling comprised small subsets of macrophages, epithelial cells and endothelial cells, and their progeny remained relatively rare long after irradiation and transient Hedgehog activation. Quantities and activities of salivary gland resident macrophages were substantially and rapidly impaired by irradiation and restored by Hedgehog activation. Conversely, depletion of salivary gland macrophages by clodronate liposomes compromised the restoration of irradiation-impaired salivary function by transient Hedgehog activation. Single cell RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR of sorted cells indicated that Hedgehog activation greatly enhances paracrine interactions between salivary gland resident macrophages, epithelial progenitors, and endothelial cells through Csf1, Hgf, and C1q signaling pathways. Consistently, expression of these paracrine factors and their receptors in salivary glands decreased following irradiation but were restored by transient Hedgehog activation. These findings reveal that resident macrophages and their pro-repair paracrine factors are essential for the rescue of irradiation-impaired salivary function by transient Hedgehog activation and are promising therapeutic targets of radiotherapy-induced irreversible dry mouth.

33000207|t|Impact of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms on vitiligo susceptibility and clinical features in a Southeastern European Caucasian population.
33000207|a|An association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and vitiligo has been suggested. However, previous studies have reported contradictory results while including limited data among Caucasians. The aim of this single-center study was to evaluate the effect of three common VDR gene polymorphisms (FokI, TaqI and BsmI) on susceptibility and clinical aspects of vitiligo in a Southeastern European Caucasian population. A total of 110 unrelated vitiligo cases and 509 general population controls were enrolled from October 2018 to November 2019. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood after de-identification and anonymization of the samples and genotyped for the selected VDR polymorphisms by the qPCR (melting curve analysis). Subgroup analysis by clinical features among subsets of patients indicated that, compared to subjects with the FokI TT genotype or T allele, carriers of the FokI CC genotype or C allele exhibited significantly decreased risk of developing vitiligo before the age of 30 [TT vs. CC: odds ratio (OR)=0.286, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.083-0.984, P=0.041; T vs. C: OR=0.545, 95% CI: 0.313-0.948, P=0.031]. Intra-patient analysis also revealed that, compared to T allele, the presence of TaqI C allele was adversely associated with the incidence of concurrent leukotrichia (T vs. C: OR=1.874, 95% CI: 1.018-3.451, P=0.042). Comparisons between the case and control groups showed no evidence to support an association between susceptibility to vitiligo and the VDR BsmI, TaqI, and FokI polymorphisms in this cohort. Thus, the studied VDR polymorphisms might indirectly impact the clinical course and treatment decision-making despite their lack of association with vitiligo per se. Further research with larger sample sizes, especially across Caucasian individuals, should be performed to confirm these findings.

33000223|t|Mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in males with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens: Reproductive implications and genetic counseling (Review).
33000223|a|Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is predominantly caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CBAVD accounts for 2-6% of male infertility cases and up to 25% of cases of obstructive azoospermia. With the use of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, testicular or epididymal sperm aspiration, intracytoplasmic sperm injection and in vitro fertilization, patients affected by CBAVD are able to have children who do not carry CFTR gene mutations, thereby preventing disease. Therefore, genetic counseling should be provided to couples receiving assisted reproductive techniques to discuss the impact of CFTR gene mutations on reproductive health. In the present article, the current literature concerning the CFTR gene and its association with CBAVD is reviewed.

33002325|t|Retrospective implementation of the Milan system for reporting salivary gland cytopathology; a review of 5 years in a specialized cancer center.
33002325|a|BACKGROUND: The Milan system for reporting salivary gland cytopathology (MSRSGC) aims to standardize terminology, facilitate communication, and optimize management by providing risk of malignancy (ROM) for each category. Our retrospective cohort aims to study the reproducibility of reporting using the MSRSGC and to calculate the ROM for each category. METHODS: Cases of fine needle aspiration (FNA) of salivary glands and related cervical lymph nodes were retrieved from our files between 2015 to 2019. From a total of 63 cytology cases, 57 cases had available material for cytological reexamination of which 45 cases had follow up data. All cases were reviewed independently by two pathologists and reclassified based on the MSRSGC. The reclassification of cases for both pathologists was compared and the ROM for each diagnostic category was calculated. RESULTS: The 57 cases were studied. Both pathologists had initial concordance in classification of 52 of 57 cases. The remainder five cases were concurred upon after combined review. The cases were classified as: Non Diagnostic (ND); (n = 8), Non Neoplastic (NN); (n = 7), Atypia of Undetermined Significance (AUS); (n = 8), Neoplasm Benign (NB) (n = 10), Salivary Gland Neoplasm of Uncertain Malignant Potential (SUMP) (n = 5), Suspicious for Malignancy (SM) (n = 1) and Malignant (M) (n = 18). The ROM was: ND: (33.3%); NN: (0%); AUS (33.3%); NB (0%); SUMP (25%); SM (100%) and M (100%). CONCLUSION: Applying the MSRSGC is reproducible which facilitates standardization of reports and stratifying cases preoperatively. In general, the ROM for our cases was close to that reported in the literature.

33002347|t|Application of the Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology to cystic salivary gland lesions.
33002347|a|BACKGROUND: Cystic salivary gland lesions present diagnostic challenges on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens that are related to sampling limitations and a broad differential diagnosis. This study evaluated the benefit of applying the Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC) to a series of cystic salivary gland lesions. METHODS: The pathology archives at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were searched to identify cystic salivary gland FNA specimens over a 19-year period (2000-2018). Patient demographics, cytomorphologic features, and clinical and surgical follow-up were recorded. The MSRSGC was applied to the cases. The risk of malignancy (ROM) and the risk of neoplasia (RON) were calculated for each category. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight cases were identified (96 males and 82 females) with a mean age of 53 years (range, 4-90 years). After the MSRSGC was applied, there were 52 nondiagnostic cases (29.2%), 80 nonneoplastic cases (44.9%), 35 cases of atypia of undetermined significance (AUS; 19.7%), 3 benign neoplasms (1.7%), 3 salivary gland neoplasms of uncertain malignant potential (SUMPs; 1.7%), 4 cases suspicious for malignancy (SFM; 2.2%), and 1 malignant case (0.6%). One hundred fifty-six of the 178 patients (87.6%) had follow-up data available. The RON and ROM values for cases with surgical follow-up were 33.3% (3 of 9) and 22.2% (2 of 9) for the nondiagnostic category, 42.9% (9 of 21) and 19% (4 of 21) for the nonneoplastic category, 76.5% (13 of 17) and 29.4% (5 of 17) for the AUS category, 100.0% (2 of 2) and 50.0% (1 of 2) for the SUMP category, and 100% (2 of 2) and 100% (2 of 2) for the SFM category, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the MSRSGC to cystic salivary gland lesions improves patient management by preventing unnecessary surgery for nonneoplastic conditions. The ROM was highest in the SFM category (100%), which was followed by the SUMP, AUS, nondiagnostic, and nonneoplastic categories. Less than adequate specimens may increase the diagnosis of AUS.

33002788|t|Application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) improves self-renewal of human spermatogonial stem cells in two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture systems.
33002788|a|Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are very sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, so male infertility is a great challenge for prepubertal cancer survivors. Cryoconservation of testicular cells before cancer treatment can preserve SSCs from treatment side effects. Different two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture systems of SSCs have been used in many species as a useful technique to in vitro spermatogenesis. We evaluated the proliferation of SSCs in 2D and 3D culture systems of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). testicular cells of four brain-dead patients cultivated in 2D pre-culture system, characterization of SSCs performed by RT-PCR, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and their functionality assessed by xenotransplantation to azoospermia mice. PRP prepared and dosimetry carried out to determine the optimized dose of PRP. After preparation of PRP scaffold, cytotoxic and histological evaluation performed and SSCs cultivated into three groups: control, 2D culture by optimized dose of PRP and PRP scaffold. The diameter and number of colonies measured and relative expression of GFRa1 and c-KIT evaluated by real-time PCR. Results indicated the expression of PLZF, VASA, OCT4, GFRa1 and vimentin in colonies after 2D pre-culture, xenotransplantation demonstrated proliferated SSCs have proper functionality to homing in mouse testes. The relative expression of c-KIT showed a significant increase as compared to the control group (*: p < 0.05) in PRP- 2D group, expression of GFRa1 and c-KIT in PRP scaffold group revealed a significant increase as compared to other groups (***: p < 0.001). The number and diameter of colonies in the PRP-2D group showed a considerable increase (p < 0.01) as compared to the control group. In PRP- scaffold group, a significant increase (p < 0.01) was seen only in the number of colonies related to the control group. Our results suggested that PRP scaffold can reconstruct a suitable structure to the in vitro proliferation of SSCs.

33002921|t|Molecular Profiling of Salivary Oncocytic Mucoepidermoid Carcinomas Helps to Resolve Differential Diagnostic Dilemma With Low-grade Oncocytic Lesions.
33002921|a|Oncocytic mucoepidermoid carcinoma (OMEC) is a rare but diagnostically challenging variant of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). OMEC is notable for differential diagnostic considerations that are raised as a result of overlap with other benign and low-grade oncocytic salivary gland tumors. Diffuse and strong immunoreactivity of p63 protein may be useful in distinguishing OMEC from its mimics. However, focal p63 staining can be present in benign oncytomas. Presence of mucin-containing cells, mucinous cystic formation, and foci of extravasated mucin are considered a hallmark of MEC. True mucocytes may be, however, very few and hardly discernable in OMECs. Recent evidence has shown that most MECs harbor gene fusions involving MAML2. A retrospective review of archived pathology files and the authors' own files was conducted to search for "low-grade/uncertain oncocytic tumor," "oncocytoma," and "oncocytic carcinoma" in the period from 1996 to 2019. The tumors with IHC positivity for p63 and/or p40, and S100 negativity, irrespective of mucicarmine staining, were tested by next-generation sequencing using fusion-detecting panels to detect MAML2 gene rearrangements. Two index cases from consultation practice (A.S. and A.A.) of purely oncocytic low-grade neoplasms without discernible mucinous cells showed a CRTC1-MAML2 fusion using next-generation sequencing, and were reclassified as OMEC. In total, 22 cases of oncocytic tumors, retrieved from the authors' files, and from the Salivary Gland Tumor Registry, harbored the MAML2 gene rearrangements. Presence of mucocytes, the patterns of p63 and SOX10 immunopositivity, and mucicarmine staining were inconsistent findings. Distinguishing OMEC devoid of true mucinous cells from oncocytoma can be very challenging, but it is critical for proper clinical management. Diffuse and strong positivity for p63 and visualization of hidden mucocytes by mucicarmine staining may be misleading and does not always suffice for correct diagnosis. Our experience suggests that ancillary studies for the detection of MAML2 rearrangement may provide useful evidence in difficult cases.

33002989|t|Ocular leprosy: from bench to bedside.
33002989|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ocular manifestations of leprosy do occur despite advances in the areas of leprosy research. Understanding the nuances in the domain shall guide the clinician for effective patient-centered care. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the existence of microbiologic cure for leprosy, ocular manifestations of this disease do occur. Advances in genetic and genomic studies have better characterized the interaction that the bacteria has with the host. The ocular features vary with the spectrum of the disease. Its careful correlation can help to predict the bacillary load of the patient. Investigations are particularly relevant in multibacillary cases. The WHO suggests a treatment duration longer than the 2 years in ocular involvement. SUMMARY: The isolation of lepra bacilli from the iris biopsy in negative skin smear patients and multidrug therapy completion highlights the potential role of bactericidal agents in the planned intraocular treatment. Lepra reactions need careful titration of oral steroids and appropriate antibacterial agents. Advances in phacoemulsification with in the bag implantation of intraocular lenses is a game changer in the management of the most common cause of blindness of leprosy. Advances in vaccine research in leprosy are promising.

33003533|t|Comparison of the Tree-Based Machine Learning Algorithms to Cox Regression in Predicting the Survival of Oral and Pharyngeal Cancers: Analyses Based on SEER Database.
33003533|a|This study aims to demonstrate the use of the tree-based machine learning algorithms to predict the 3- and 5-year disease-specific survival of oral and pharyngeal cancers (OPCs) and compare their performance with the traditional Cox regression. A total of 21,154 individuals diagnosed with OPCs between 2004 and 2009 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Three tree-based machine learning algorithms (survival tree (ST), random forest (RF) and conditional inference forest (CF)), together with a reference technique (Cox proportional hazard models (Cox)), were used to develop the survival prediction models. To handle the missing values in predictors, we applied the substantive model compatible version of the fully conditional specification imputation approach to the Cox model, whereas we used RF to impute missing data for the ST, RF and CF models. For internal validation, we used 10-fold cross-validation with 50 iterations in the model development datasets. Following this, model performance was evaluated using the C-index, integrated Brier score (IBS) and calibration curves in the test datasets. For predicting the 3-year survival of OPCs with the complete cases, the C-index in the development sets were 0.77 (0.77, 0.77), 0.70 (0.70, 0.70), 0.83 (0.83, 0.84) and 0.83 (0.83, 0.86) for Cox, ST, RF and CF, respectively. Similar results were observed in the 5-year survival prediction models, with C-index for Cox, ST, RF and CF being 0.76 (0.76, 0.76), 0.69 (0.69, 0.70), 0.83 (0.83, 0.83) and 0.85 (0.84, 0.86), respectively, in development datasets. The prediction error curves based on IBS showed a similar pattern for these models. The predictive performance remained unchanged in the analyses with imputed data. Additionally, a free web-based calculator was developed for potential clinical use. In conclusion, compared to Cox regression, ST had a lower and RF and CF had a higher predictive accuracy in predicting the 3- and 5-year OPCs survival using SEER data. The RF and CF algorithms provide non-parametric alternatives to Cox regression to be of clinical use for estimating the survival probability of OPCs patients.

33004689|t|Single hepatocytes show persistence and transcriptional inactivity of hepatitis B.
33004689|a|There is no cure for the more than 270 million people chronically infected with HBV. Nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs), the mainstay of anti-HBV treatment, block HBV reverse transcription. NUCs do not eliminate the intranuclear covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), from which viral RNAs, including pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), are transcribed. A key gap in designing a cure is understanding how NUCs affect HBV replication and transcription because serum markers yield an incomplete view of intrahepatic HBV. We applied single-cell laser capture microdissection and droplet digital PCR to paired liver biopsies collected from 5 HBV/HIV-coinfected persons who took NUCs over 2-4 years. From biopsy 1 to 2, proportions of HBV-infected hepatocytes declined with adherence to NUC treatment (P < 0.05); we extrapolated that eradication of HBV will take over 10 decades with NUCs in these participants. In individual hepatocytes, pgRNA levels diminished 28- to 73-fold during NUC treatment, corresponding with decreased tissue HBV core antigen staining (P < 0.01). In 4 out of 5 participants, hepatocytes with cccDNA but undetectable pgRNA (transcriptionally inactive) were present, and these were enriched in 3 participants during NUC treatment. Further work to unravel mechanisms of cccDNA transcriptional inactivation may lead to therapies that can achieve this in all hepatocytes, resulting in a functional cure.

33006767|t|Randomised controlled trial of topical corticosteroid and home-based narrowband UVB for active and limited vitiligo - results of the HI-Light Vitiligo trial.
33006767|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence for the effectiveness of vitiligo treatments is limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine effectiveness of (a) hand-held narrowband-UVB (NB-UVB) and (b) combination of potent topical corticosteroid (TCS) and NB-UVB compared to TCS, for localised vitiligo. METHODS: Pragmatic, 3-arm, placebo-controlled RCT (9 months' treatment; 12 months' follow-up). Adults and children, recruited from secondary care and community, aged >=5 years with active vitiligo affecting <10% of skin, were randomised 1:1:1 to receive: TCS (mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment + dummy NB-UVB); NB-UVB (NB-UVB + placebo TCS); or combination (TCS + NB-UVB). TCS applied once daily on alternating weeks; NB-UVB administered alternate days in escalating doses, adjusted for erythema. PRIMARY OUTCOME: treatment success at 9 months at target patch assessed using participant-reported Vitiligo Noticeability Scale, with multiple imputation for missing data. RESULTS: 517 participants were randomised: TCS (n=173), NB-UVB (n = 169), combination (n=175). Primary outcome data were available for 370 (72%) participants. Target patch treatment success was 17% (TCS), 22% (NB-UVB) and 27% (combination). Combination treatment was superior to TCS: adjusted between group difference 10.9% (95% CI 1.0% to 20.9%; p= 0.032; NNT=10). NB-UVB alone was not superior to TCS: adjusted between group difference 5.2% (95% CI -4.4% to 14.9%; p= 0.290; NNT=19). Participants using interventions >75% expected were more likely to achieve treatment success, but effects were lost once treatment stopped. Localised grade 3 or 4 erythema was reported in 62 (12%) participants (including 3 with dummy light). Skin thinning was reported in 13 (2.5%) participants (including 1 with placebo ointment). CONCLUSION: Combination treatment with home-based hand-held NB-UVB plus TCS is likely to be superior to TCS alone for treatment of localised vitiligo. Combination treatment was relatively safe and well tolerated but was only successful in around a quarter of participants.

33007075|t|Comparison of outcomes of HCT in blast phase of BCR-ABL1- MPN with de novo AML and with AML following MDS.
33007075|a|Comparative outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for BCR-ABL1- myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in blast phase (MPN-BP) vs de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and AML with prior myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs; post-MDS AML), are unknown. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared HCT outcomes in 177 MPN-BP patients with 4749 patients with de novo AML, and 1104 patients with post-MDS AML, using multivariate regression analysis in 2 separate comparisons. In a multivariate Cox model, no difference in overall survival (OS) or relapse was observed in patients with MPN-BP vs de novo AML with active leukemia at HCT. Patients with MPN-BP in remission had inferior OS in comparison with de novo AML in remission (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.76]) due to higher relapse rate (HR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.69-2.80]). MPN-BP patients had inferior OS (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.00-1.43]) and increased relapse (HR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.31-1.96]) compared with post-MDS AML. Poor-risk cytogenetics were associated with increased relapse in both comparisons. Peripheral blood grafts were associated with decreased relapse in MPN-BP and post-MDS AML (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57-0.86]). Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was similar between MPN-BP vs de novo AML, and MPN-BP vs post-MDS AML. Total-body irradiation-based myeloablative conditioning was associated with higher NRM in both comparisons. Survival of MPN-BP after HCT is inferior to de novo AML in remission and post-MDS AML due to increased relapse. Relapse-prevention strategies are required to optimize HCT outcomes in MPN-BP.

33007432|t|Immunotherapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, where are we?
33007432|a|A couple of molecular-targeting medications, such as Lenvatinib, are available for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in addition to Sorafenib in an advanced stage. Approval for the use of immune check-point inhibitors, such as Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab has shifted the paradigm of current HCC treatment, and the monotherapy or in combination with Lenvatinib or Sorafenib has significantly extended overall survival or progression-free survival in a large portion of patients. A combination of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitor Atezolizumab with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, Bevacizumab, has recently achieved promising outcome in unresectable HCC patients. Other immunotherapy, such as chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has achieved an evolutional success in hematologic malignancies, and has extended its use in deadly solid tumors, such as HCC. Although there exist various barriers, novel approaches are developed to move potential adoptive T cell therapy strategies, including cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), T cell receptor (TCR) T cells, CAR-T cells, to clinical application.

33008039|t|The Inhibitory Effect of Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Its Active Compound Oleocanthal on Prostaglandin-Induced Uterine Hypercontraction and Pain-Ex Vivo and In Vivo Study.
33008039|a|Primary dysmenorrhea is a common occurrence in adolescent women and is a type of chronic inflammation. Dysmenorrhea is due to an increase in oxidative stress, which increases cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, increases the concentration of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha), and increases the calcium concentration in uterine smooth muscle, causing excessive uterine contractions and pain. The polyphenolic compound oleocanthal (OC) in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of extra virgin olive oil and its active ingredient oleocanthal (OC) on prostaglandin-induced uterine hyper-contraction, its antioxidant ability, and related mechanisms. We used force-displacement transducers to calculate uterine contraction in an ex vivo study. To analyze the analgesic effect, in an in vivo study, we used an acetic acid/oxytocin-induced mice writhing model and determined uterus contraction-related signaling protein expression. The active compound OC inhibited calcium/PGF2alpha-induced uterine hyper-contraction. In the acetic acid and oxytocin-induced mice writhing model, the intervention of the EVOO acetonitrile layer extraction inhibited pain by inhibiting oxidative stress and the phosphorylation of the protein kinase C (PKC)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)/ myosin light chain (MLC) signaling pathway. These findings supported the idea that EVOO and its active ingredient, OC, can effectively decrease oxidative stress and PGF2alpha-induced uterine hyper-contraction, representing a further treatment for dysmenorrhea.

33008079|t|Biochemical and Molecular Investigation of In Vitro Antioxidant and Anticancer Activity Spectrum of Crude Extracts of Willow Leaves Salix safsaf.
33008079|a|Organic fractions and extracts of willow (Salix safsaf) leaves, produced by sequential solvent extraction as well as infusion and decoction, exhibited anticancer potencies in four cancerous cell lines, including breast (MCF-7), colorectal (HCT-116), cervical (HeLa) and liver (HepG2). Results of the MTT assay revealed that chloroform (CHCl3) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc)-soluble fractions exhibited specific anticancer activities as marginal toxicities were observed against two non-cancerous control cell lines (BJ-1 and MCF-12). Ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry Q-Exactive  HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap  coupled with liquid chromatography (UHPLC) indicated that both extracts are enriched in features belonging to major phenolic and purine derivatives. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS), employing annexin V-FITC/PI double staining indicated that the observed cytotoxic potency was mediated via apoptosis. FACS analysis, monitoring the increase in fluorescence signal, associated with oxidation of DCFH to DCF, indicated that the mechanism of apoptosis is independent of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Results of immunoblotting and RT-qPCR assays showed that treatment with organic fractions under investigation resulted in significant up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein and mRNA markers for Caspase-3, p53 and Bax, whereas it resulted in a significant reduction in amounts of both protein and mRNA of the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2. FACS analysis also indicated that pre-treatment and co-treatment of human amniotic epithelial (WISH) cells exposed to the ROS H2O2 with EtOAc fraction provide a cytoprotective and antioxidant capacity against generated oxidative stress. In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of natural phenolic and flavonoid compounds with unparalleled and unique antioxidant and anticancer properties.

33008633|t|Toxicity after adjuvant therapy for stage III uterine cancer.
33008633|a|OBJECTIVE: The optimal adjuvant therapy for stage III endometrial cancer is unknown. Studies have suggested that combination therapy with chemotherapy and radiation is associated with improved survival. We examined early and late-term toxicities associated with chemotherapy (CT), external beam radiotherapy (RT), or combination chemoradiotherapy for stage III uterine cancer. METHODS: The SEER-Medicare database was used to identify women age >= 65 years with stage III uterine cancer who received adjuvant CT, RT, or chemoradiotherapy from 2000 to 2015. The associations between therapy and early and late-term toxicities identified with billing claims, hospitalizations and emergency department visits were examined using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: A total of 2185 patients were identified including 574 (26.3%) who received CT, 636 (29.1%) who received RT, and 975 (44.6%) who received chemoradiotherapy. The proportion of patients receiving chemoradiotherapy or CT increased over time. During the first 6 and 12 months of adjuvant therapy, RT was associated with a lower risk of early-term toxicity compared to chemoradiotherapy (aRR = 0.59, 95%CI 0.49-0.70 and aRR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.67-0.86, respectively) while CT shared a similar risk of early toxicities as chemoradiotherapy. CT and RT shared a similar risk of late-term toxicities compared to chemoradiotherapy. CT and RT alone were associated with a higher hazard for overall mortality than chemoradiotherapy (aHR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.10-1.47 and aHR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.44, respectively). CONCLUSION: Chemoradiotherapy is associated with lower mortality compared to single modality therapy and has a similar risk of early and late term toxicities compared to CT, though higher risk of early toxicities compared to RT.

33008815|t|Implications of MYC Rearrangements in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma.
33008815|a|BACKGROUND: Rearrangements involving the MYC protooncogene are common in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), but their prognostic significance is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of MYC rearrangement on clinical characteristics, treatment response, and survival in newly diagnosed MM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study including 1342 patients seen in Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, from January 2006 to January 2018, and who had cytogenetic testing by fluorescence in-situ hybridization at diagnosis, including MYC testing using the break apart FISH probe (8q24.1). RESULTS: A rearrangement involving MYC was found in 8% of patients, and was associated with elevated beta2-microglobulin, >=50% bone marrow plasma cells, IgA MM, and the co-occurrence of trisomies. There were no differences in overall response rates between patients with and without MYC rearrangement when induction chemotherapy was proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based, immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)-based or PI+IMiD-based. Overall survival was shorter in patients with MYC rearrangement compared to patients without MYC rearrangement (5.3 vs. 8.0 years, P<0.001). MYC rearrangement was associated with increased risk of death on multivariate analysis when high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, ISS stage III, and >=70 years of age were included (risk ratio: 1.5, P=0.007). CONCLUSION: MYC rearrangement is associated with high disease burden and is an independent adverse prognostic factor in newly diagnosed MM.

33009053|t|Fendrix vs Engerix-B for Primo-Vaccination Against Hepatitis B Infection in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
33009053|a|INTRODUCTION: To compare Engerix-B and Fendrix hepatitis B virus for primo vaccination in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Patients with IBD were randomized 1:1 to receive Engerix-B double dose or Fendrix single dose at months 0, 1, 2, and 6. Anti-HBs titers were measured 2 months after the third and fourth doses. Response to vaccination was defined as anti-HBs >=100 UI/L. Anti-HBs titers were measured 2 months after the third and fourth doses and again at 6 and 12 months after the fourth dose. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients were randomized (54% received Engerix-B and 46% Fendrix). Overall, 45% of patients responded (anti-HBs >=100 IU/L) after 3 doses and 71% after the fourth dose. The response rate after the fourth dose was 75% with Fendrix vs 68% with Engerix-B (P = 0.3). Older age and treatment with steroids, immunomodulators, or anti-tumor necrosis factor were associated with a lower probability of response. However, the type of vaccine was not associated with the response. Anti-HBs titer negativization occurred in 13% of patients after 6 months and 20% after 12 months. Anti-HBs >=100 IU/L after vaccination was the only factor associated with maintaining anti-HBs titers during follow-up. DISCUSSION: We could not demonstrate a higher response rate of Fendrix (single dose) over Engerix-B (double dose). A 4-dose schedule is more effective than a 3-dose regimen. Older age and treatment with immunomodulators or anti-tumor necrosis factors impaired the success. A high proportion of IBD patients with protective anti-HBs titers after vaccination loose them over time. The risk of losing protective anti-HBs titers is increased in patients achieving anti-HBs <100 IU/L after the vaccination.

33009067|t|Improving Hepatitis B Virus Vaccination Responses in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Does Greater Dose and Greater Frequency Lead to Greater Protection?
33009067|a|Prevention of hepatitis B (HBV) infection is particularly important for patients with inflammatory bowel disease because of risks of HBV reactivation on immunosuppressive therapies. However, immune responses to standard HBV vaccination regimens are suboptimal. Chaparro et al. compared immune responses to 2 vaccines, an adjuvanted HBV vaccine (Fendrix) and double-dosed standard vaccine (Engerix-B) using an accelerated, 4-dose regimen (0, 1, 2, and 6 months). Although the study did not demonstrate superiority of one vaccine over another, several lessons can be derived regarding immune response to vaccinations among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including the need to consider nonstandard regimens for patients on immunosuppression. These lessons can be translated broadly, including to a potential future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine when one becomes available.

33009139|t|Infections after anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for hematologic malignancies: timeline, prevention, and uncertainties.
33009139|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Data on the infectious complications of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR-T-cell) therapies are scant. The approaches to preventing and managing infections among CAR-T-cell recipients are extrapolated from those of patients with other hematological malignancies. Understanding the incidence and risk factors of infections in these patients will improve clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Infections occur in 23-42% of CAR-T-cell recipients and are most frequent in the first month after infusion, declining sharply thereafter. Risk factors include preinfusion (e.g., prior hematopoietic cell transplant, underlying malignancy) and postinfusion variables (e.g., cytokine release syndrome [CRS], neutropenia). Neutropenic fever after CAR-T-cell therapy is nearly universal but is confounded by CRS. The timeline of infections can be divided into preinfusion (because of the preparative regimen); 0-30 days after infusion, when bacterial infections predominate; and 30 days onwards, when respiratory viral infections predominate. Fungal and herpesviridae infections are uncommon. SUMMARY: Recent studies have shed light on the epidemiology of infections after CAR-T-cell therapy. Future efforts should focus on identifying modifiable risk factors for infection, defining neutropenic fever in the setting of CRS, determining the benefit of antimold prophylaxis, and identifying the optimal approach to viral monitoring, vaccination, and immunoglobulin replacement.

33009996|t|Comparison of the survival outcome of neoadjuvant therapy followed by radical surgery with that of concomitant chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage IB2-IIIB cervical adenocarcinoma.
33009996|a|PURPOSE: To compare the survival outcome of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) (chemotherapy or chemotherapy and intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) followed by radical surgery and of concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with locally advanced cervical adenocarcinoma and identify predictors of cervical adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our medical records of cervical adenocarcinoma patients treated with either NAT + surgery or CCRT in our institution from January 2013 to December 2017. The patients were treated with two-dimensional radiotherapy or three-dimensional-conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy combined with intracavitary brachytherapy. The regimen of concomitant chemotherapy was weekly cisplatin. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was paclitaxel plus cisplatin. The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: We enrolled 121 patients. There were 42 (34.7%) patients in the NAT + surgery group and 79 (65.3%) in the CCRT group. After univariate multivariate analysis, NAT was an independent predictor of OS (p = 0.008) and PFS (p = 0.006). After propensity score matching, the 5-year OS rates in the NAT + surgery and CCRT groups were 25% and 4%, respectively (p = 0.00014), and the 5-year PFS rates were 25% and 4%, respectively (p = 0.00015). Subgroup analysis showed that the 5-year OS and PFS rates in the NACT + surgery and CCRT groups were both 20% and 8%, respectively (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Compared with CCRT, NAT followed by radical surgery had better OS and PFS in locally advanced cervical adenocarcinoma. In subgroup analysis, OS and PFS were longer for NACT + surgery than for CCRT.

33010430|t|Myeloablative Conditioning for Allogeneic Transplantation Results in Superior Disease-Free Survival for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes with Low/Intermediate, but not High Disease Risk Index: A CIBMTR Study: Superior DFS with MAC compared to RIC HCT in AML/MDS with low/intermediate risk DRI.
33010430|a|Myeloablative (MAC) as compared to reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is generally associated with lower relapse risk after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, disease specific risk factors in AML/MDS can further inform when MAC vs. RIC may yield differential outcomes. We analyzed HCT outcomes stratified by the disease risk index (DRI) in 4387 adults (age 40-65 years) to identify the impact of conditioning intensity. In the low/intermediate risk DRI cohort, RIC was associated with lower non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR=0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.88; p<0.001), but significantly higher relapse risk (HR=1.54, 95% CI 1.35-1.76; p<0.001) and thus inferior disease-free survival (DFS) (HR=1.19, 95% CI 1.07-1.33; p=0.001). In the high/very high risk DRI cohort, RIC resulted in marginally lower NRM (HR=0.83, 95% CI 0.68-1.00; p=0.051), and significantly higher relapse risk (HR=1.23, 95% CI 1.08-1.41; p=0.002) leading to similar DFS using either RIC or MAC. These data support MAC over RIC as the preferred conditioning intensity for AML/MDS with low/intermediate risk DRI, but similar benefit to RIC in high/very high risk DRI. Novel MAC regimens with less toxicity could benefit all, but more potent anti-neoplastic approaches are needed for the high/very high risk DRI group.

INTERVENTIONS: None MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of documented sexual health counseling and contraception use were assessed for frequency. Associations between patient factors and these outcomes were assessed using Pearson chi2 and Fisher's exact tests, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of these outcomes. RESULTS: In this cohort (n=157), the median age was 20.5, and the most common diagnoses were hematologic (40.8%) and thyroid (31.2%) malignancies. 33.1% were documented as receiving sexual health counseling and 48.4% used contraception. Younger patients (ages 15-20) were less likely to receive counseling (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.70, P=.005). Receiving counseling (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.35-8.34, P=.009) and sexual activity (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.80-9.68, P=.001) were significantly associated with contraception use. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual health counseling was documented infrequently during oncologic care for AYA women, especially for younger patients. However, such conversations were associated with a higher likelihood of contraception use. There is a need to improve rates of counseling in this high-risk setting, in which adolescents may be more vulnerable with regards to sexual health.

33011282|t|Prevalence of Herpes -, Measles morbillivirus-, Parvovirus B19 - and Rubella viruses Immunoglobulin G among women with chronic Hepatitis B of reproductive age in Denmark: A cross-sectional study.
33011282|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against seven viruses (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1&2, measles morbillivirus, parvovirus B19, rubella and varicella-zoster virus), which can potentially compromise maternal and fetal wellbeing, differs based on country of origin among women with chronic Hepatitis B (CHB). METHOD: This study was a single-center, hospital based cross-sectional study. The study included women with CHB 15-45 years of age, included in the Danish Database for Hepatitis B and C. Seroprevalence estimates were calculated with a 95% confidence interval and were compared between age groups, regions of origin and to the general population. RESULTS: 177 women were included in the study. Overall, the seroprevalences of antibodies were similar among women with CHB with origin outside Denmark and compared to the general population in Denmark, but there was a notable difference in the seroprevalence of antibodies against herpes simplex 2 between women from Africa (37.1% CI 95% 22.0;55.1) and women from the Middle East (2.5% CI 95% 0.1;14.7). CONCLUSION: Women with CHB with origin outside Denmark do not appear to differ based on origin or be at greater risk of acquiring these viruses during pregnancy compared to the Danish population.

33011636|t|Portrait of a CAF: The story of cancer-associated fibroblasts in head and neck cancer.
33011636|a|Complex interactions take place during cancer formation and progression. In this regard, there has been increasing focus on the non-malignant cells that make up the tumour microenvironment (TME), and how they interact with malignant tumour cells. TME is highly heterogeneous and has a major influence on tumour behaviour and therapy response. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), one of the main components of the TME, establish dangerous liaisons with cancer cells and other components of the TME to shape a tumour-supportive environment in many types of cancer. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) encompass the malignant neoplasms arising from the mucosal lining of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx. The TME of HNSCC contributes to tumour progression and this stromal compartment may be an interesting target for treatment. There is an emerging picture of the behaviour of CAFs in HNSCC; how they affect and are affected by the TME. We aim to summarise and discuss the current understanding of CAFs in head and neck cancer, exploring CAF activation and heterogeneity, and interaction with cancer cells and other cells within the TME.

33012081|t|Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disruption Is Corrected by Lithium in a Case of Bipolar Disorder with Familial BRCA1 Mutation.
33012081|a|Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by severe mood symptoms, often accompanied by circadian rhythm disturbances. Preclinical studies indicate that lithium, a first line treatment for BD, has effects on circadian rhythms. 1 However, less attention has been given to the effects of lithium on the clinical symptoms of BD related to circadian rhythm disruption. We present a case of a BD patient with profound disruption in sleep/wake activity and show that lithium potently corrected her circadian rhythm disturbances.

33012122|t|Isolated atrial amyloidosis suspected by electrophysiological voltage mapping and diagnosed by 99m Tc-DPD scintigraphy.
33012122|a|We present not-yet-seen multimodal images of a 55-year-old female patient with isolated atrial amyloidosis (IAA) who clinically suffered from multiple atrial arrhythmias and heart failure symptoms with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. We aim to show structural and functional abnormalities detected by electrophysiological voltage mapping, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [cMRI; atrial strain measurements, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) visualization], and 99m Tc-DPD scintigraphy. Bipolar voltage mapping performed during two electrophysiological procedures showed diffuse left atrial low-voltage areas (bipolar < 0.5 mV) and also a moderately diseased right atrium suspected of infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Catheter ablation did successfully treat a left atrial and two right atrial focal tachycardias. For further diagnostics, a 3T cMRI was performed, revealing a subendocardial circumferential left atrial LGE and pathological atrial strain measurements, especially during conduit and reservoir phase. Afterwards, nuclear imaging with 559 MBq of 99m Tc-DPD was performed. The scan revealed amyloid infiltration of the left atrium. Neither an uptake in the ventricular myocardium nor an extra-cardiac uptake of DPD was seen. Genetic testing for transthyretin amyloidosis mutations in this patient was negative, and peripheral neuropathy was ruled out by electromyogram analysis. The synopsis of these findings reveals IAA as the most possible diagnosis and showed isolated atrial nuclear tracer uptake with 99m Tc-DPD scintigraphy for the first time. Non-invasive imaging techniques might help in suggesting IAA but need further investigation.

33012227|t|Multi-omic detection of Mycobacterium leprae in archaeological human dental calculus.
33012227|a|Mineralized dental plaque (calculus) has proven to be an excellent source of ancient biomolecules. Here we present a Mycobacterium leprae genome (6.6-fold), the causative agent of leprosy, recovered via shotgun sequencing of sixteenth-century human dental calculus from an individual from Trondheim, Norway. When phylogenetically placed, this genome falls in branch 3I among the diversity of other contemporary ancient strains from Northern Europe. Moreover, ancient mycobacterial peptides were retrieved via mass spectrometry-based proteomics, further validating the presence of the pathogen. Mycobacterium leprae can readily be detected in the oral cavity and associated mucosal membranes, which likely contributed to it being incorporated into this individual's dental calculus. This individual showed some possible, but not definitive, evidence of skeletal lesions associated with early-stage leprosy. This study is the first known example of successful multi-omics retrieval of M. leprae from archaeological dental calculus. Furthermore, we offer new insights into dental calculus as an alternative sample source to bones or teeth for detecting and molecularly characterizing M. leprae in individuals from the archaeological record. This article is part of the theme issue 'Insights into health and disease from ancient biomolecules'.

33012246|t|Cytomegalovirus-induced cutaneous ulcer mimicking vasculitis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematous: A case report and review of the literature.
33012246|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease which can be complicated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection during its course. CMV reactivation can mimic an SLE flare and lead to delay in diagnosis. Here, we reported a previously diagnosed SLE patient who presented with fever, leukopenia, and cutaneous ulcers. Initially, this was diagnosed as an SLE flare and the patient was treated with higher doses of corticosteroids but no improvement was observed. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions inside the endothelial cells in the skin biopsy as well as positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for CMV antigen were clues to the correct diagnosis of CMV reactivation. Treatment with ganciclovir resulted in clinical resolution. In this report, a very rare clinical form of CMV infection manifesting as cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis on the lower extremity is described and the literature regarding this case is reviewed.

33012523|t|Integrated analysis of tumor mutation burden and immune infiltrates in endometrial cancer.
33012523|a|To explore the prognostic value of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and its correlation with immune infiltrates in endometrial cancer. Transcriptome and somatic mutation profiles of Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) were downloaded from TCGA database. Somatic mutations were analyzed by "maftools" and visualized in waterfall plot. We calculated TMB of each patients and divided all patients into the high-TMB group and the low-TMB group by the median threshold. Survival analysis and Wilcoxon test were used to investigate the prognostic value of TMB and its association with clinical variables. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 2 TMN groups and functional analysis was performed to find out significant biological pathways. A TMB-related signature was conducted by multivariate analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to predict accuracy of the model, meanwhile, a validation cohort from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) was obtained to verify the signature. Then we estimated association between TMB and immune infiltrates by CIBERSORT algorithm and figured out prognostic immune cells of UCEC in TIMER database. Total 575 samples including 25 normal tissues and 552 tumor samples were enrolled from TCGA database. PTEN mutations accounted for the most and single nucleotide polymorphism and C>T transitions were most frequent forms of somatic mutations in UCEC. The low-TMB group possessed worse survival than the high-TMB group (P = 0.004). DEGs in 2 TMB groups were mostly enriched in adaptive immune response and immunoglobulin/immune receptor component. A TMB-related signature consisting of GFAP, EDN3, CXCR3, PLXNA4, SST presented good predictability with area under the curve (AUC) = 0.686. In FUSCC validation cohort, the high-risk group possessed worse survival outcome than the low-risk group (P = 0.015). Immune infiltrates was correlated to survival in UCEC and low TMB were associated with less immune infiltrates, which suggested poor immune response. TMB was not only related to overall survival but also immune infiltrates in UCEC. The TMB-related signature (GFAP, EDN3, CXCR3, PLXNA4, SST) had good predictability for overall survival in endometrial cancer. Our study might have some merits in elucidating potential mechanism of TMB and immune infiltrates in UCEC and providing guidance of immunotherapy for endometrial cancer.

33012872|t|Lumateperone for the Treatment of Schizophrenia.
33012872|a|Introduction: Schizophrenia is a severe psychotic disorder that is diagnosed by the presence of hallucinations or delusions along with disorganized speech, disorganized thought, or negative symptoms that are present for at least six months. Roughly 1 in 10,000 people a year are diagnosed with this psychiatric disorder. It is a chronic disorder requiring a lifetime of treatment of which antipsychotics have been the mainstay of this treatment. First-generation antipsychotics have dystonia, parkinsonism, and development of Tardive Dyskinesia as major side effects, and they are also nonspecific in terms of their actions. Second Generation antipsychotics target more specific dopamine and sometimes serotonin receptors with less dystonic side effects; however, there are additional concerns for the development of metabolic syndrome. This review aims to look at new medication on the market, lumateperone, for the treatment of Schizophrenia. Recent studies: In one four week study with 60mg and 120mg of Lumateperone compared, 4mg of Risperdal, and a placebo found that Lumateperone significantly decreased the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline. Safety analysis of this study also found that Lumateperone was not associated with EPS or significant weight gain. Another study found that 42mg of Lumateperone significantly decreased PANSS score over placebo and 28mg of Lumateperone with associated TEAEs of somnolence, sedation, fatigue, and constipation. In an open-label safety, patients were switched from their current antipsychotic to Lumateperone and then switched back to their previous treatment after six weeks. PATIENTS were found to have statistically significant improvements in metabolic parameters, weight, and endocrine parameters, which were all lost when they were switched back to their previous treatment and their schizophrenic symptoms at pre-trial levels or improved them while on Lumateperone. In a continuation of the previous study over 12 months, 4 TEAEs occurred in 5% or more of the participants: diarrhea, dry mouth, weight decrease, and headache. Prolactin, metabolic labs, BMI, and weight all decreased as compared to the standard of care. Pooled studies revealed EPS related TEAEs were less frequent in patients receiving 42 mg lumateperone over Risperdal. Another pooled study looked at the safety profile; they found patients treated with lumateperone, two TEAEs occurred at twice the placebo rate and at a rate of 5% or more: dry mouth (5% vs. 2.2%) and sedation (24.1% vs. 10.0%) though TEAE discontinuation rates were lower than with Risperdal. Summary: Taken together, data from these trials suggest that lumateperone can effectively treat positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Lumateperone entrance to the market introduces an innovative way to treat schizophrenia featuring both a novel mechanism of action and a markedly reduced side effect profile. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of Lumateperone in treating bipolar disorder in addition to schizophrenia.

33012874|t|Cariprazine to Treat Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder in Adults.
33012874|a|Purpose of Review: Antipsychotics are the standard of care when it comes to the treatment of Schizophrenia, and they are often used in Bipolar as well. Their use can come with adverse effects such as extrapyramidal movements, metabolic complications as well as cardiovascular complications such as a prolonged QT interval. Treatment for these side effects ranges from the treatment of the complications up to the cessation of the medication, which could come at the expense of the user's stability. Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have an increased risk of suicide and increased morbidity. The purpose of this review presents the background, evidence, and indications for the use of the new second-generation antipsychotic Cariprazine, which has a primary function as a D3 and D2 partial agonist, with higher selectivity for the D3 receptor type. Recent Findings: Schizophrenia is currently teated by dopamine antagonists and/or 5HT modulators, each with their own set of side effects. Bipolar disorder is mostly treated with mood stabilizers. Studies looking at the efficacy and safety of cariprazine have shown in two phase II trials and phase III trials the decrease in PANSS scores in schizophrenia. The most common adverse effects were akathisia, insomnia, constipation, and other extrapyramidal side effects. A unique side effect of Cariprazine caused bilateral cataract and cystic degeneration of the retina in the dog following daily oral administration for 13 weeks and/or 1 year and retinal degeneration in rats following daily oral administration for 2 years. Another study showed that cariprazine had significant efficacy in preventing relapse in patients with schizophrenia. The time to the loss of sustained remission was significantly longer (P = .0020) for cariprazine compared to placebo (hazard ratio = 0.51) during the double-blind treatment. 60.5% of patients treated with cariprazine and 34.9% of patients treated with placebo sustained remission through the final visit (odds ratio [OR] = 2.85; P = .0012; number needed to treat [NNT] = 4. Another Phase IIIb study looked at negative symptoms and used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Factor Score for Negative Symptoms (PANSS-FSNS), and it found that the use of cariprazine, from baseline to week 26, led to a greater least-squares mean change in PANSS-FSNS than did risperidone. Another study looked at the quality of life years with the treatment of cariprazine and showed those treated with cariprazine had superior quality of life compared to those treated with risperidone. In terms of bipolar disorder, it showed a decrease in depressive symptoms as measured by decreased MADRs scores with a dose of 3.0mg/day. A phase II study looked at the use of cariprazine in mania or mix states and showed cariprazine significantly decreased YMRS scores compared to placebo, least-square mean difference of -6.1 (p < 0.001). The metabolic parameters demonstrated comparable changes except for fasting glucose in which cariprazine was associated with elevations in glucose levels compared to placebo (p < 0.05). Another phase III study showed significant differences in YMRS total score mean change between cariprazine versus placebo-treated group. Changes in metabolic profiles in all mentioned studies were minimal. Summary: Cariprazine, in recent studies, has shown some promise in being able to treat both bipolar disorder in manic, depressed, and mixed states as well as schizophrenia. Side effects noted as adverse events in these studies are similar in profile to the medications that were developed in the past. With better relapse prevention, cariprazine could be a reasonable alternative clozapine.

33012876|t|An Update on the Efficacy and Tolerability of Oral Ketamine for Major Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
33012876|a|Background: Intravenous Ketamine has shown robust antidepressant efficacy although other routes of administration are currently needed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of oral ketamine for depression. Methods: A comprehensive search of major electronic databases from inception to April 2020 was performed. Studies of oral ketamine for depression, from case series to randomized clinical trials, were eligible. Randomized controlled trials were included in a meta-analysis, focusing on response, remission, time to effect, and side effects. Results: A total of 917 articles were identified with 890 studies screened, yielding a total of 10 studies included in our systematic review.Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 161, mean age 37.9 +- 9.5 years, 58.6% females) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis suggested a significant antidepressant effect of oral ketamine (SMD: -0.75; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.43; p<0.0001; I2 = 0%) although remission rates (RR:2.77; 95% CI:0.96, 8.00; p = 0.06) and response rates (RR:2.58; 95% CI:0.94,7.08; p = 0.07) were marginal compared to placebo at the endpoint. Oral ketamine antidepressant effects seemed to take effect at the 2nd week (SMD: -0.71; 95% CI: -1.08, -0.35; p = 0.001; I2 = 0%). There were no significant differences in the overall side-effects between oral ketamine and the placebo group (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.89-1.83; p = 0.19). Conclusion: This focused meta-analysis of oral ketamine suggests a marginal efficacy for major depressive disorder without increased risk of adverse events. Further larger sample studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, analyzing differential response/remission rates by affective disorder, optimal dosing strategies, and its long-term effects.

33012913|a|A 70-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus developed a painful pupil-involving right third nerve palsy, ipsilateral fourth nerve palsy, and periorbital paraesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated enhancement and thickening of the right third nerve, and she was diagnosed with presumed Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Repeated imaging seven months later showed resolution of the enhancing thickened oculomotor nerve, but the patient developed signs of oculomotor synkinesis. This presentation demonstrates a rare case of oculomotor synkinesis secondary to inflammation.

33013111|t|Patterns of Failure After Trimodal Treatment in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Initial Experiences from a High-Risk Endemic Area.
33013111|a|Recurrence is a significant problem faced in patients with esophageal cancer even after treatment with trimodal approach. We report patterns of failure in our patients of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) treated with trimodal approach. This is a single-institution retrospective analysis of 46 patients of locally advanced ESCC (treated between 2013 and 2017) managed by trimodal treatment approach. Variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. Survival statistics were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. With a median follow-up of about 28 months, we noted an overall recurrence rate of 37% (17/46), with most of the failures being distant, with or without locoregional recurrence (4 isolated distant and 6 combined distant and locoregional). Median RFS was 34 months and median OS was yet to be reached at the last follow-up. To conclude, optimization of treatment approaches in ESCC is of utmost importance and need of the hour to further improve outcomes in these patients.

33013631|t|Interleukin-1beta Drives Cellular Senescence of Rat Astrocytes Induced by Oligomerized Amyloid beta Peptide and Oxidative Stress.
33013631|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. With no reliable treatment that delays or reverses the progress of AD, effective medical drugs, and interventions for AD treatment are in urgent need. Clinical success for patients thus relies on gaining a clearer understanding of AD pathogenesis to feed the development of novel and potent therapy strategies. It is well-established that inflammatory processes are involved in the pathology of AD, and recent studies implicated senescence of glial cells as an important player in the progression of AD. Methods: We did a preliminary screen in rat astrocytes for the five most abundant inflammatory factors in neuroinflammation, namely IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-beta1, and TNF-alpha, and found that IL-1beta could efficiently induce cellular senescence. After that, SA-beta-gal staining, immunofluorescence, ELISA, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting were used to explore the underlying mechanism through which IL-1beta mediates cellular senescence of rat astrocytes. Results: IL-1beta-induced cellular senescence of rat astrocytes was accompanied by increased total and phosphorylated tau. Further experiments showed that both oligomerized amyloid beta (Abeta) and H2O2 treatment can induce cellular senescence in rat astrocytes and increase the production and secretion of IL-1beta from these cells. Subsequent mechanistic study revealed that activation of NLRP3 mediates Abeta and H2O2-induced maturation and secretion of IL-1beta. Conclusion: Our results suggest that IL-1beta mediates senescence in rat astrocytes induced by several common adverse stimuli in AD, implicating IL-1beta and NLRP3 as valuable diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD.

33013667|t|The Application of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Ischemic Stroke, and Dementia: A Systematic Review.
33013667|a|Objective: To investigate the application of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), ischemic stroke and dementia. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE (from inception) and EMBASE (from 1980) to end 2019 for human studies that measured retinal parameters in cerebral SVD, ischemic stroke, and dementia using OCTA. Results: Fourteen articles (n = 989) provided relevant data. Ten studies included patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (n = 679), two investigated pre-symptomatic AD participants (n = 154), and two investigated monogenic SVD patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (n = 32) and Fabry disease (n = 124). Methods to reduce bias and risk factor adjustment were poorly reported. Substantial methodological variations between studies precluded a formal meta-analysis. Quantitative measurements revealed significant yet inconclusive changes in foveal avascular zone, perfusion density, and vessel density (VD) in AD, presymptomatic AD, and SVD patients. Two (n = 160) of three studies (n = 192) showed association between decreased VD and increased white matter hyperintensities. In three (n = 297) of seven studies (n = 563), better cognitive function was associated with increased VD. One study (n = 52) suggested increased VD was associated with increased ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness in AD yet with no covariate adjustment. Conclusions: Changes in retinal microvasculature identified using OCTA are associated with monogenic SVD and different stages of AD, but data are limited and partly confounded by methodological differences. Larger studies with risk factors adjustment and more consistent OCTA methods are needed to fully exploit this technology. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020166929.

33013845|t|Association of MBL2 Exon 1 Polymorphisms With Multibacillary Leprosy.
33013845|a|Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum protein of innate immunity, with a central role in the activation of the complement system through the lectin pathway. This protein is encoded by MBL2 gene, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms located at exon 1, such as rs5030737 C>T (D variant), rs1800450 G>A (B variant), and rs1800451 G>A (C variant), may change the MBL structure and the serum concentration. MBL2 polymorphisms have been associated with several infectious diseases, including leprosy. Host immune response has a major impact on the clinical manifestation of leprosy since only a few individuals infected with Mycobacterium leprae will develop the disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms (rs5030737, rs1800450, and rs1800451) on the MBL levels and leprosy immunopathogenesis. This case-control study included 350 leprosy patients from Southern Brazil, with 279 classified as multibacillary (MB) and 71 as paucibacillary (PB). The control group consisted of 350 non-consanguineous individuals, who were not diagnosed with leprosy or other infectious and autoimmune diseases. Genotyping was performed by PCR-sequence specific primers, and the MBL serum concentrations were evaluated by ELISA. MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms were analyzed individually and grouped as genotypes, considering "A" as the wild allele and "O" as the presence of at least one polymorphism (D, B, or C variants). Differences were not observed in the distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies between leprosy per se patients and controls. However, in a haplotypic analysis, the TGG haplotype presented a risk for development of leprosy per se in women when compared to the wild haplotype (CGG) (OR = 2.69). Comparing patients with MB and PB, in a multivariate analysis, the B variant was associated with the susceptibility of developing the MB form of leprosy (OR = 2.55). Besides that, the CAG haplotype showed an increased susceptibility to develop MB leprosy in women compared to men. It was observed that the A/O genotype in women was associated with a susceptibility to leprosy development per se (OR = 1.66) and progression to MB leprosy (OR = 3.13). In addition, the MBL serum concentrations were in accordance with the genotyping analysis. In summary, our data suggest that MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk to leprosy development and progression.

33013901|t|Non-human Primate Determinants of Natural Killer Cells in Tissues at Steady-State and During Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection.
33013901|a|Natural killer (NK) cells play essential roles in immunity to viruses and tumors. Their function is genetically determined but also modulated by environmental factors. The distribution and functional regulation of these cells vary depending on the tissue. NK cell behavior in lymphoid tissues is so far understudied. Non-human primate (NHP) models are essential for the development of therapies and vaccines against human diseases, and access to NHP tissues allows insights into spatial regulations of NK cells. Here, we investigated tissue-specific parameters of NK cells from NHP species, i.e., cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis), African green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), and baboon (Papio anubis). By comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis of NK cells from secondary lymphoid organs, intestinal mucosa, liver, and blood, we identified tissue- and species-specific patterns of NK cell frequencies, phenotypes, and potential activity. Also, we defined the tissue-specific characteristics of NK cells during infection by the simian immunodeficiency virus. Altogether, our results provide a comprehensive anatomic analysis of NK cells in different tissues of primates at steady-state and during a viral infection.

33013903|t|Fecal Metabolites Were Altered, Identified as Biomarkers and Correlated With Disease Activity in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in a GC-MS-Based Metabolomics Study.
33013903|a|Gut metabolites are products of the crosstalk between microbes and their host and play an important role in the occurrence, development, diagnosis, and treatment of autoimmune diseases. This work profiled the fecal metabolome of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and analyzed the potential roles of metabolites in the diagnosis and development of SLE. Fecal sample from 29 SLE patients without any other diseases and 30 healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed by metabolomics profiling. All participants took no antibiotics in the month before sampling and clinical data collecting. The metabolome profiles of patients with SLE and HCs were significantly different. Thirty fecal metabolites, such as deoxycholic acid, erucamide, L-tryptophan and putrescine, were significantly enriched, while nine metabolites, such as glyceric acid, gamma-tocopherol, (Z)-13-octadecenoic acid and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, were depleted in SLE patients vs. HCs. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of L-valine, pyrimidine, erucamide, and L-leucine during ROC analysis were 0.886, 0.833, 0.829, and 0.803, indicating their good diagnostic potential. Moreover, the combination of L-valine, erucamide and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol gave an AUC of 0.959. SLE-altered metabolites were significantly located in 28 pathways, such as ABC transporters (p = 3.40E-13) and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (p = 2.11E-12). Furthermore, SLE-altered fecal metabolites were closely correlated with SLE indicators, e.g., L-tryptophan was positively correlated with the SLEDAI-2K (p = 0.007). Our results suggest that the SLE fecal metabolome is closely associated with the occurrence and development of SLE and is of great diagnostic value.

33013931|t|Case Report: Hyper IgM Syndrome Identified by Whole Genome Sequencing in a Young Syrian Man Presenting With Atypical, Severe and Recurrent Mucosal Leishmaniasis.
33013931|a|A previously healthy 19-year-old Syrian man presented with atypical and severe mucosal leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania tropica. During a 2-year period, he had three severe relapses despite various treatment strategies, including liposomal amphotericin B and Miltefosine. Because of the unusual clinical presentation, potential underlying immunodeficiency was investigated. Normal T and NK cell counts were found. The B cell count was slightly elevated at 0.7 x 109 cells/L (0.09 x 109 to 0.57 x 109 cells/L), but the proportions of memory and isotype switched memory B cells were severely diminished IgG levels were low, at 309 mg/dL (610-1490 mg/dL). The initial IgM and IgA levels were within normal range, but the IgA levels decreased to 57 mg/dL (70-430 mg/dL) during follow up. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) was initially suspected, because the immunological results of low IgG and IgA, low switched memory B cells, no profound T cell deficiency found and absence of secondary cause of hypogammaglobulinemia were compatible with this diagnosis (ESID 2019). However, the highly unusual and severe clinical presentation of L. tropica is not suggestive of B-cell deficiency or CVID. Eventually a pathogenic nonsense variant in the CD40 ligand gene [p.(Arg11*)] was identified by whole genome sequencing, thus enabling the diagnosis of X-linked hyper IgM syndrome. This case illustrates and supports the potential for the use of whole genome sequencing in accurate diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies.

33014128|t|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance in a black African cohort-a clinicopathologic study.
33014128|a|Background: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance (DFSP) is the commonest, yet rare, dermal sarcoma globally. There are few reports in the literature of this neoplasm in Nigerians and indeed in sub-Saharan Africa. This study documents our institutional practice observation and compares it with those from other regions of the world. Methods and materials: This study was a retrospective review of all cases of histologically diagnosed DFSP at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, spanning a period of 27 years (January 1989-December 2016). Data on patient age, gender, tumour location, size, tumour recurrence and metastasis status were obtained from clinical and surgical pathology archival files and records. Results: Sixty-nine cases of DFSP were recorded over the period reviewed with a male-female ratio of 1.6:1. The mean age of the study population was 39.6 years. The youngest patient was 5-year old, while the oldest was 86 years and the modal age group was the 4th decade. The trunk was the commonest anatomic tumour location. Recurrences were seen in seven cases with recurrence interval ranging from 6 to 240 months. The correlation between tumour size and age was non-significant (r = -0.183; p = 0.182). There was fibrosarcoma-like transformation in three cases (4.3%) studied. Conclusion: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance is rare in our population and occurs more commonly in males and on the trunk. Recurrence can occur beyond the recommended follow-up period of 10 years.

33014378|t|Linkage of alterations in systemic iron homeostasis to patients' outcome in sepsis: a prospective study.
33014378|a|Background: Sepsis, a dysregulated host response following infection, is associated with massive immune activation and high mortality rates. There is still a need to define further risk factors and laboratory parameters predicting the clinical course. Iron metabolism is regulated by both, the body's iron status and the immune response. Iron itself is required for erythropoiesis but also for many cellular and metabolic functions. Moreover, iron availability is a critical determinant in infections because it is an essential nutrient for most microbes but also impacts on immune function and intravascular oxidative stress. Herein, we used a prospective study design to investigate the putative impact of serum iron parameters on the outcome of sepsis. Methods: Serum markers of iron metabolism were measured in a prospective cohort of 61 patients (37 males, 24 females) with sepsis defined by Sepsis-3 criteria in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Regulation of iron parameters in patients stratified by focus of infection and co-medication as well as association of the markers with sepsis severity scores and survival were investigated with linear and logistic regression corrected for sex and age effects. Results: Positive correlations of increased serum iron and ferritin concentrations upon ICU admission with the severity of organ failure (SOFA score) and with mortality were observed. Moreover, high TF-Sat, elevated ferritin and serum iron levels and low transferrin concentrations were associated with reduced survival. A logistic regression model consisting of SOFA and transferrin saturation (SOFA-TF-Sat) had the best predictive power for survival in septic ICU patients. Of note, administration of blood transfusions prior to ICU admission resulted in increased TF-Sat and reduced survival of septic patients. Conclusions: Our study could show an important impact of serum iron parameters on the outcome of sepsis. Furthermore, we identified transferrin saturation as a stand-alone predictor of sepsis survival and as a parameter of iron metabolism which may in a combined model improve the prediction power of the SOFA score. Trial registration: The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki on biomedical research. The study was approved by the institutional ethics review board of the Medical University Innsbruck (study AN2013-0006).

33014443|t|Therapeutic HL-Contact Lens versus Standard Bandage Contact Lens for Corneal Edema: A Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Crossover Study.
33014443|a|Introduction: To compare the safety and efficacy of the Therapeutic Hyper-CL  lens versus a standard bandage contact lens (PureVision B&L) for chronic corneal edema. Methods: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, crossover study. Chronic corneal edema patients were randomized to one of two arms. The first arm was fitted with the Therapeutic Hyper-CL  lens while the second arm was fitted with a standard soft bandage contact lens. Both arms were treated with 5% sodium chloride 6 times a day. After a 7-day treatment period, there was a 7-day washout period, after which the arms were crossed over. Patients were evaluated at days 0 (baseline), 7 (following first treatment allocation), 14 (following washout), and 21 (following second treatment allocation). The primary outcomes were 3 lines of BCVA (best corrected visual acuity) improvement. Results: In total, 49 patients were enrolled. There was significantly greater BCVA improvement rate >3 lines (30.4% versus 17.4%, P=0.04) in the Therapeutic Hyper-CL  lens group. The mean change in BCVA lines was significantly greater for the Therapeutic Hyper-CL  lens (3.4 +- 6.7 versus 0.9 +- 2.3, P=0.02). Conclusions: The Therapeutic Hyper-CL  lens was associated with a higher chance for significant visual acuity improvement when compared to a standard bandage contact lens combined with 5% sodium chloride. This trial is registered with NCT02660151.

33014460|t|Pregnancy Outcomes among Patients with Sickle Cell Disease in Brazzaville.
33014460|a|Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world. It combines, in its homozygous form, chronic hemolytic anemia, vasoocclusive complications, and susceptibility to infections. It is well known that the combination of pregnancy and sickle cell disease promotes the occurrence of complications that are sometimes fatal for the mother and/or the fetus. Objective: The objective of the current study was to compare pregnancy outcomes among women with SCD with those of women without the diagnosis of SCD. Materials and methods. It was a case-control study carried out in four maternity hospitals in Brazzaville in 2 years (July 2017-June 2019). It concerned 65 parturients with SS homozygous SCD. The mode of childbirth and maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality were compared with those of 130 non-sickle cell pregnant women. Results: The average age was 27 years for SCD women and 31 years for non-SCD women. The average gestational age at delivery was 35 weeks for SCD women and 38 weeks for non-SCD women. From the logistic regression analysis using the comparison group as the reference group, there was excessive risk in SCD compared to non-SCD of infection (29.3% vs. 4.6%, OR = 21.7, 95% CI [7.6-62.7]; p=0.001), cesarean (63% vs. 35.4%, OR = 3.1, 95% CI [1.6-5.7]; p=0.001), prematurity (75.4% vs. 30.8%, OR = 8, 95% CI [3.0-23.2]; p=0.001), low birth weight (52.3% vs. 16.1%, OR = 4.7, 95% CI [2.4-9.4]; p=0.001), neonatal requiring admission to the intensive care unit (40.3% vs. 17.5%, OR = 3.2, 95% CI [1.6-6.3]; p=0.01), and neonatal death (21.5% vs. 4.8%, OR = 4.3, 95% CI [1.5-12.2]; p=0.01). Conclusion: The risk of pregnancy in patients with homozygous sickle cell anemia remains high, on both the maternal and fetal sides.

33014527|t|Chondroprotective Effects of Combination Therapy of Acupotomy and Human Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Knee Osteoarthritis Rabbits via the GSK3beta-Cyclin D1-CDK4/CDK6 Signaling Pathway.
33014527|a|Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are highly chondrogenic and can be used to treat knee osteoarthritis (KOA) by alleviating cartilage defects. Acupotomy, a biomechanical therapy guided by traditional Chinese medicine theory, alleviates cartilage degradation and is widely used in the clinic to treat KOA by correcting abnormal mechanics. However, whether combining acupotomy with ASCs will reverse cartilage degeneration by promoting chondrocyte proliferation in KOA rabbits is unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of combination therapy of acupotomy and ASCs on chondrocyte proliferation and to determine the underlying mechanism in rabbits with KOA induced by knee joint immobilization for 6 weeks. After KOA modeling, five groups of rabbits (acupotomy, ASCs, acupotomy + ASCs, model and control groups) received the indicated intervention for 4 weeks. The combination therapy significantly restored the KOA-induced decrease in passive range of motion (PROM) in the knee joint and reduced the elevated serum level of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a marker for cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the combination therapy inhibited cartilage injury. The combination therapy also significantly blocked increases in the mRNA and protein expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and decreases in the mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1/CDK4 and cyclin D1/CDK6 in cartilage. These findings indicated that the combination therapy mitigated knee joint immobility, promoted chondrocyte proliferation and alleviated cartilage degeneration in KOA rabbits, and these effects may be mediated by specifically regulating the GSK3beta-cyclin D1-CDK4/CDK6 pathway.

33014529|t|Pyroptosis Plays a Role in Osteoarthritis.
33014529|a|Recent studies have revealed novel forms of cell death beyond the canonical types of cellular apoptosis and necrosis, and these novel forms of cell death are induced by extreme microenvironmental factors. Pyroptosis, a type of regulated cell death, occurs when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) induce the activation of cysteine-aspartic protease 1 (caspase-1) or caspase-11, which can trigger the release of the pyrogenic cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18. Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common joint disease worldwide, is characterized by low-grade inflammation and increased levels of cytokines, including IL-1beta and IL-18. Additionally, some damaged chondrocytes associated with OA exhibit morphological changes consistent with pyroptosis, suggesting that this form of regulated cell death may contribute significantly to the pathology of OA. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis and shows the critical role of NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3; NLR refers to "nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat") inflammasomes. We also provide evidence describing potential role of pyroptosis in OA, including the relationship with OA risk factors and the contribution to cartilage degradation, synovitis and OA pain.

33014539|t|Infrapatellar Fat Pad and Knee Osteoarthritis.
33014539|a|Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent arthritis typically characterized by degradation of cartilage. However, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Currently, osteoarthritis is best considered a disease of the whole "joint organ". Infrapatellar fat pad (IFP), an adipose tissue near synovium, is now attaching importance to researchers for its inflammatory phenotype. In this narrative review, a large body of evidence has been gathered for the involvement of IFP in the development of knee osteoarthritis. Additionally, the underlying mechanisms of how IFP can be involved in this process have been proposed. However, further investigations are needed to better understand its precise role in this process and its underlying mechanism, and beyond that, to develop new strategies to slow down the degenerative process and explore an effective and timely diagnosis of the disease.

33014570|t|Semi-supervised deep learning based 3D analysis of the peripapillary region.
33014570|a|Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become an essential tool in the evaluation of glaucoma, typically through analyzing retinal nerve fiber layer changes in circumpapillary scans. Three-dimensional OCT volumes enable a much more thorough analysis of the optic nerve head (ONH) region, which may be the site of initial glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Automated analysis of this region is of great interest, though large anatomical variations and the termination of layers make the requisite peripapillary layer and Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) segmentation a challenging task. Several machine learning-based segmentation methods have been proposed for retinal layer segmentation, and a few for the ONH region, but they typically depend on either heavily averaged or pre-processed B-scans or a large amount of annotated data, which is a tedious task and resource-intensive. We evaluated a semi-supervised adversarial deep learning method for segmenting peripapillary retinal layers in OCT B-scans to take advantage of unlabeled data. We show that the use of a generative adversarial network and unlabeled data can improve the performance of segmentation. Additionally, we use a Faster R-CNN architecture to automatically segment the BMO. The proposed methods are then used for the 3D morphometric analysis of both control and glaucomatous ONH volumes to demonstrate the potential for clinical utility.

33014644|t|Giant Leiomyosarcoma Arising in Posterior Thigh: Management of a Rare Case.
33014644|a|Leiomyosarcoma, primarily a tumor of smooth muscle origin, frequently originates from the uterus, retroperitoneum, and intra-abdominal region. Rarely, the tumor may arise from the conjunctiva, inferior vena cava, or oral cavity. Here we report a case of a 65-year-old male patient who presented with a swelling in the posterior thigh for six months. The swelling was progressively increasing in size for the last two months. Examination of thigh showed a swelling of 20x30 cm in size, which was firm, non-compressible, immobile, and not transilluminating. CT scan showed no metastasis in the liver, lung, or bone. The histopathology report showed poorly differentiated leiomyosarcoma involving the muscles of the posterior compartment of the left thigh. The tumor was resected, and the patient was referred to rehabilitation clinic. Early diagnosis of such cases is essential to improve the outcome in patients as these tumors can metastasize early.

33014659|t|Study of the Effect of Different Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes on Splenomegaly.
33014659|a|Background Several recent studies have shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and its different genotypes are a predominant and leading cause of cirrhosis and splenomegaly in different regions of the world. Advanced stage of cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension that causes splenomegaly. This complication may have many other manifestations such as anemia, infections, and bleeding disorders in severe stages. This study aimed to determine the effect of different HCV genotypes on the development of splenomegaly and to assess which HCV genotypes are more associated with it. Materials and methods A total of 483 conveniently sampled HCV patients were included in this descriptive cross-sectional study. Six genotypes (1, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, and mixed) were studied, and 80 patients for each of these genotypes were included. Data were collected from patient medical records regarding patient demographic details, HCV serology and genotyping, and sonographic size of the spleen. Results In total, splenomegaly was present in 14.1% (n=68) patients. The development of splenomegaly was significantly associated with old age, as 25.2% (n=26) of patients above 60 years of age (n=103) developed splenomegaly (P=0.005). Our study determined that splenomegaly was significantly related to HCV genotypes 3a, 3b, and 1 (P<0.001, P=0.017, and P=0.019, respectively). By taking mixed genotype as a reference, the odds of developing splenomegaly with genotype 3a were the highest (OR = 9.481; CI=95%). Conclusions Our study concludes that HCV genotype 3a, 3b, and 1, and age above 60 years have a significant association with splenomegaly. Genotype 3a has the highest risk of developing splenomegaly. Therefore, our study demands screening, early diagnosis, and prompt treatment of these particular HCV genotypes to prevent complications and risk of mortality.

33014660|t|Spontaneous Infertility Secondary to Testicular Sarcoidosis: A Case Report.
33014660|a|Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that can affect any region of the body. Rarely, sarcoid involvement may even involve the male genitourinary tract, including the testicles. Testicular sarcoidosis causes spontaneous and severe effects on male fertility due to obstructive azoospermia. The case presented offers an insight into successful fertility treatment in a patient with obstructive testicular sarcoidosis. The patient and his partner presented to the clinic two years post successful natural conception of their first child with subsequent infertility. Within this period, the male partner was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and was on a treatment plan consisting of methotrexate and glucocorticoids. Complete azoospermia was confirmed via two separate semen analyses six weeks apart. The patient's testosterone (free and total), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were all within normal limits. With approval of pulmonology, methotrexate was discontinued for three months; however, subsequent semen analysis revealed no improvement. The patient was referred to urology, who confirmed the presence a palpable testicular nodule. Treatment of infertility was eventually achieved via testicular sperm aspiration (TESA) followed by in vitro fertilization (IVF) using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This treatment was successful in achieving one blastocyst and one morula, which were replaced via fresh transfer, resulting in a successful term singleton pregnancy. The possibility of obstructive azoospermia should be considered in males diagnosed with sarcoidosis who are seeking to preserve their reproductive potential.

33014755|t|The Discovery of Clinically Applicable Biomarkers for Bipolar Disorder: A Review of Candidate and Proteomic Approaches.
33014755|a|Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric condition which affects innumerable people across the globe. The etiopathogenesis of BD is multi-faceted with genetic, environmental and psychosocial factors playing a role. Hitherto, the diagnosis and management of BD are purely on empirical grounds as we lack confirmed biomarkers for this condition. In this regard, hypothesis-driven investigations have been unable to identify clinically applicable biomarkers, steering the field towards newer technologies. Innovative, state-of-the-art techniques like multiplex immunoassays and mass spectrometry can potentially investigate the entire proteome. By detecting up or down regulated proteins, novel biomarkers are identified and new postulates about the etiopathogenesis of BD are specified. Hence, biological pathways are uncovered which are involved in the initiation and advancement of the disease and new therapeutic targets are identified. In this manuscript, the extant literature is thoroughly reviewed and the latest findings on candidate BD biomarkers are provided, followed by an overview of the proteomic approaches. It was found that due to the heterogeneous nature of BD no single biomarker is feasible, instead a panel of tests is more likely to be useful. With the application of latest technologies, it is expected that validated biomarkers will be discovered which will be useful as diagnostic tools and help in the delivery of individually tailored therapies to the patients.

33014768|t|Comprehensive Analysis of the Expression, Relationship to Immune Infiltration and Prognosis of TIM-1 in Cancer.
33014768|a|TIM-1 is a critical gene that regulates T-helper cell development. However, little research has revealed the distribution, prognosis, and immune infiltration of TIM-1 in cancers. TCGA, GEO, Oncomine, TIMER, Kaplan-Meier, PrognoScan, GEPIA, TISIDB, and HPA databases were used to analyze TIM-1 in cancers. High TIM-1 expression was observed in bladder, cholangio, head and neck, colorectal, gastric, kidney, liver, lung adenocarcinoma, skin, uterine corpus endometrial, and pancreatic cancers compared to the normal tissues, and immunofluorescence shows that TIM-1 is mainly localized in vesicles. Simultaneously, high TIM-1 expression was closely related with poorer overall survival in gastric, lung adenocarcinoma, and poorer disease-specific survival in gastric cancer in the TCGA cohort, and was validated in the GEO cohort. Moreover, high expression of TIM-1, correlated with clinical relevance of gastric cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, was associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed TIM-1 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer compared to the normal tissues. In summary, we applied integrated bioinformatics approaches to suggest that TIM-1 can be used as a prognostic biomarker in gastric and lung adenocarcinoma, which might provide a novel direction to explore the pathogenesis of gastric and lung adenocarcinoma.

33014799|t|LINC00673 Represses CDKN2C and Promotes the Proliferation of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells by EZH2-Mediated H3K27 Trimethylation.
33014799|a|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of the most abundant epigenetic regulators, play an important role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In the current study, the functions and mechanisms of the lncRNA LINC00673 were investigated. The expression levels of LINC00673 and its potential target genes were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in ESCC surgical specimens and ESCC cell lines. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) was employed to detect the subcellular location and the levels of LINC00673 in ESCC samples from patients with different survival times. LINC00673 function in ESCC carcinogenesis was also evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Cell cycle synchronization was performed using serum withdrawal; the cell cycle was monitored by fluorescence analysis and cellular DNA was detected by flow cytometry. The molecular mechanisms underlying LINC00673 were explored via Western blotting, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and ChIP-PCR. Up-regulated LINC00673 was associated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients and promoted the proliferation of ESCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Compared to the control group, depletion of LINC00673 in ESCC cells arrested the cell cycle, at least, at the G1/S checkpoint. Knockdown of LINC00673 significantly enhanced posttranscriptional expression of CDKN2C, and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) was enriched at the promoter region of CDKN2C. After inhibiting EZH2, the CDKN2C expression levels were increased. The present findings are the first to reveal that LINC00673 represses CDKN2C expression and promotes ESCC cell proliferation by elevating EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 levels. These data suggest that LINC00673 regulates the cell cycle in ESCC and that it is a promising target for clinical therapy.

33014819|t|The PET-Derived Tumor-to-Liver Standard Uptake Ratio (SUV TLR ) Is Superior to Tumor SUVmax in Predicting Tumor Response and Survival After Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer.
33014819|a|Background: The maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) derived from 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) have some well-known shortcomings in predicting treatment response and prognosis in oncology. The standardized SUVmax with an appropriate reference background may overcome this problem in some instances. This study explored the prognostic value of the tumor-to-liver SUVmax ratio (SUVTLR) and the tumor-to-blood pool SUVmax ratio (SUVTBR) in predicting the objective response (OR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 128 newly diagnosed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who were treated with CCRT. The SUVmax of primary tumor, SUVTLR, SUVTBR and clinicopathologic features data were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the predictors of tumor response. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that SUVTLR was superior to SUVmax and SUVTBR in predicting treatment response. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that advanced tumor stage (hazard ratio [HR] = 9.67; 95% CI: 1.15-81.28; P = 0.037) and high SUVTLR (HR = 21.92; 95% CI: 2.26-212.96; P = 0.008) were independent predictors of poor treatment response. Cox regression analysis showed that good clinical tumor response (p < 0.014, HR =0.501; 95% CI: 0.288-0.871) was a favorable independent predictive factor for OS, while an advanced tumor stage (p = 0.018, HR = 1.796; 95% CI: 1.107-2.915) and a high SUVTLR (p < 0.002, HR = 2.660; 95% CI: 1.425-4.967) were prognostic factors for poor OS. The median OS of patients in the low SUVTLR and high SUVTLR groups was 13.47 vs. 19.30 months, respectively. Conclusions: PET-derived SUVTLR is superior to tumor SUVmax and SUVTBR in predicting treatment response and overall survival in patients with ESCC undergoing CCRT. High SUVTLR was an independent predictor of poor treatment response and shorter overall survival.

33014825|t|Aberrant Chloride Intracellular Channel 4 Expression Is Associated With Adverse Outcome in Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
33014825|a|Background and Methods: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which starts in the bone marrow, is a group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders. Chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) is regulated by p53, c-Myc, and TGF-beta. It induces the NF-kappaB-dependent activation of HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) and participates in tumor growth through its microenvironmental function. However, its prognostic value in AML remains unclear, as well as its co-expression biomarkers. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of CLIC4 expression using two independent large cohorts of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients. Multivariable analysis and multi-omics analysis with weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) in the CN-AML group were also presented. Based on CLIC4 and its related genes, microRNA-target gene interaction network analysis and downstream gene ontology analysis were performed to unveil the complex functions behind CLIC4. Results: We demonstrated that the overexpression of CLIC4 was notably associated with unfavorable outcome in the two independent cohorts of CN-AML patients [overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS): P < 0.0001, n = 185; OS: P = 0.016, n = 232], as well as in the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) Intermediate-I group (OS: P = 0.015, EFS: P = 0.012, n = 115), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Intermediate Risk AML group (OS and EFS: P < 0.0001, n = 225), and the non-M3 AML group (OS and EFS: P < 0.0001, n = 435). Multivariable analysis further validated CLIC4 as a high-risk factor in the CN-AML group. Multi-omics analysis presented the overexpression of CLIC4 as associated with the co-expression of the different gene sets in leukemia, up/downregulation of the immune-related pathways, dysregulation of microRNAs, and hypermethylation around the CpG islands, in open sea regions, and in different gene structural fragments including TSS1500, gene body, 5'UTR region, 3'UTR region, and the first exon. By further performing WGCNA on multi-omics data, certain biomarkers that are co-expressed with CLIC4 were also unveiled. Conclusion: We demonstrated that CLIC4 is a novel, potential unfavorable prognosticator and therapeutic target for CN-AML. As having a key role in CN-AML, the interactions between CLIC4 and other genomics and transcriptomics data were confirmed by performing microRNA-target gene interaction network analysis and gene ontology enrichment analysis. The experimental result provides evidence for the clinical strategy selection of CN-AML patients.

33014852|t|The Clinical Significance of SIRT2 in Malignancies: A Tumor Suppressor or an Oncogene?
33014852|a|Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is a member of the sirtuin protein family. It is a Class III histone deacetylase (HDACs) and predominantly localized to the cytosol. SIRT2 deacetylates histones and a number of non-histone proteins and plays a pivotal role in various physiologic processes. Previously, SIRT2 has been considered indispensable during carcinogenesis; however, there is now a significant controversy regarding whether SIRT2 is an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. The purpose of this review is to summarize the physiological functions of SIRT2 and its mechanisms in cancer. We will focus on five malignancies (breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and glioma) to describe the current status of SIRT2 research and discuss the clinical evaluation of SIRT2 expression and the use of SIRT2 inhibitors.

33014864|t|Combination of Tanshinone IIA and Cisplatin Inhibits Esophageal Cancer by Downregulating NF-kappaB/COX-2/VEGF Pathway.
33014864|a|Cisplatin (DDP) represents one of the common drugs used for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but side effects associated with DDP and drug resistance lead to the failure of treatment. This study aimed to understand whether tanshinone IIA (tan IIA) and DDP could generate a synergistic antitumor effect on ESCC cells. Tan IIA and DDP are demonstrated to restrain ESCC cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent mode. Tan IIA and DDP at a ratio of 2:1 present a synergistic effect on ESCC cells. The combination suppresses cell migration and invasion abilities, arrests the cell cycle, and causes apoptosis in HK and K180 cells. Molecular docking indicates that tan IIA and DDP could be docked into active sites with the tested proteins. In all treated groups, the expression levels of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, Bax, cleaved caspase-9, P21, P27, and c-Fos were upregulated, and the expression levels of fibronectin, vimentin, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, p-Akt, p-ERK, p-JNK, P38, COX-2, VEGF, IL-6, NF-kappaB, and c-Jun proteins were downregulated. Among these, the combination induced the most significant difference. Our results suggest that tan IIA could be a novel treatment for combination therapy for ESCC.

33014873|t|miR-29a-5p Regulates the Proliferation, Invasion, and Migration of Gliomas by Targeting DHRS4.
33014873|a|Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors in adults and exhibit a spectrum of aberrantly aggressive phenotypes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in various cancers, including gliomas; however, their specific roles and mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Studies have indicated that miR-29a is a tumor-suppressive miRNA, but the data are limited. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-29a-5p in glioma and further explored its underlying mechanisms. On the basis of bioinformatics, dehydrogenase/reductase 4 (DHRS4) was considered a potential target of miR-29a-5p and was also found to be highly expressed in gliomas in our experiments. Moreover, with a luciferase reporter assay, DHRS4 was found to be a target gene of miR-29a-5p and to be correlated with glioma proliferation, invasion, and migration in our in vivo and in vitro experiments. Simultaneously, we observed that the knockdown of DHRS4 rescued the downregulation of glioma proliferation, invasion, and migration caused by treatment with a mir-29a-5p inhibitor. The present findings demonstrate that miR-29a-5p suppresses cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by targeting DHRS4, and DHRS4 may be a potential new oncogene and prognostic factor in gliomas.

33014893|t|Serum SARS-COV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein: A Sensitivity and Specificity Early Diagnostic Marker for SARS-COV-2 Infection.
33014893|a|Objective: To explore the diagnostic value of serum severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein assay in the early stages of SARS-COV-2 infection. Methods: Serum N protein level in SARS-COV-2 infected patients and non-SARS-COV-2 infected population was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) double antibody sandwich assay. Colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was used to detect serum N protein antibodies in the above populations. Results: Fifty cases of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-positive and SARS-CoV-2 antibody-negative patients had a serum N protein positivity rate of 76%. Thirty-seven patients who were positive for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody after infection had a serum SARS-CoV-2 N protein positivity rate of 2.7%. Serum N protein test results of 633 non-SARS-COV-2 infected patients, including pregnant women, patients with other respiratory infections, and individuals with increased rheumatoid factor were all negative, with serum N protein concentration <10.00 pg/mL at 100% specificity. Using SPSS 19.0 to calculate the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve was determined to be 0.9756 (95% confidence interval 0.9485-1.000, p < 0.0001), and sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% confidence interval 81.16-96.85%) and 96.84% (95% confidence interval 95.17-97.15%), respectively. The best CUT-OFF value was 1.850 pg/mL. Conclusion: The measurement of serum SARS-COV-2 N protein has a high diagnostic value for infected patients before the antibody appears and shortens the window period of serological diagnosis. It is recommended that the manufacturer establish two different CUT-OFF values according to the purpose of the application. One CUT-OFF value is used for the diagnosis of clinical SARS-COV-2 infection, and the other is used to screen out as many suspected cases as possible.

33014930|t|COVID-19: Technology-Supported Remote Assessment of Pediatric Asthma at Home.
33014930|a|The COVID-19 crisis has pressured hospital-based care for children with high-risk asthma as they have become deprived of regular clinical evaluations. However, COVID-19 also provided important lessons about implementing novel directions for care. Personalized eHealth technology, tailored to the individual and the healthcare system, could substitute elements of hospital care and facilitate early and appropriate medical anticipation in response to imminent loss of control. This perspective article discusses new approaches to the clinical, organizational, and scientific aspects of the use of eHealth technology in pediatric asthma care in times of COVID-19, as illustrated by a case report of an acute asthma exacerbation possibly caused by COVID-19 infection.

33014947|t|Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Vasculopathy Associated With STAT3-Dominant-Negative Hyper-IgE Syndrome.
33014947|a|Dominant negative mutations in the transcription-factor STAT3 underlie the rare primary immunodeficiency Job's syndrome. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) has shown promise in correction of the underlying immunological defect, with one report suggesting HSCT can prevent development of wider connective tissue complications. Here, we report the case of a 26 year old male who developed an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction due to coronary artery ectasia and thrombosis, occurring despite pediatric allogeneic HSCT for STAT3-HIES and a predicted 10-year conventional cardiovascular risk of 0.1%. Vasculopathy associated with STAT3-HIES may persist or arise following HSCT and can precipitate life-threatening complications. This has implications for counseling and vascular surveillance, and highlights the need for further studies to determine the risk, pathogenesis, and optimal management of the vasculopathy associated with STAT3-HIES.

33014963|t|Management of Tuberculosis: Are the Practices Homogeneous in High-Income Countries?
33014963|a|Objectives: To evaluate and compare practices regarding the diagnosis, isolation measures, and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in high-income countries and mainly in Europe. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted from November 2018 to April 2019 within the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Study Group for Mycobacterial Infections (ESGMYC). The practices observed were compared to the main international guidelines. Results: Among 136 ESGMYC members, 64 (17 countries) responded to the questionnaire. In their practice, two (20.7%) or three sputum samples (79.3%) were collected for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB, alternatively induced sputum (n = 37, 67.2%), bronchoscopy (34, 58.6%), and gastric aspirates (15, 25.9%). Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) were performed by 41 (64%) respondents whatever the smear result and by 47 (73%) in case of smear-positive specimens. NAAT and adenosine deaminase measurement were used for extrapulmonary TB diagnosis in 83.6 and 40.4% of cases, respectively. For isolation duration, 21 respondents (42.9%) were keeping isolation until smear negativity. An initial treatment without ethambutol was offered by 14% (n = 9) of respondents. Corticosteroid therapy, cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure testing, and repeated lumbar puncture were carried out for central nervous system TB by 79.6, 51.9, and 46.3% of the respondents, respectively. For patients with human immunodeficiency virus-TB coinfection, the preferred antiretroviral therapy included dolutegravir 50 mg twice a day (56.8%). Comparing with the recommendations of the main guidelines, the practices are not totally consistent. Conclusion: This study shows heterogeneous practices, particularly for diagnosis, and isolation, although rapid molecular testing is implemented in most centers. More standardization might be needed.

33014989|t|Investigation of Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation on Synthetic Extracellular Matrix Peptide Hydrogels.
33014989|a|Chemical and mechanical properties of a tumor microenvironment are essential players in cancer progression, and it is important to precisely control the extracellular conditions while designing cancer in vitro models. The study investigates synthetic hydrogel matrices from multi-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalized with collagen-like peptide (CLP) CG(PKG)4(POG)4(DOG)4 alone and conjugated with either cell adhesion peptide RGD (mimicking fibronectin) or IKVAV (mimicking laminin). Human glioblastoma HROG36, rat C6 glioma cells, and A375 human melanoma cells were grown on the hydrogels and monitored for migration, proliferation, projected cell area, cell shape index, size and number, distribution of focal contacts in individual cells, and focal adhesion number. PEG-CLP-RGD induced migration of both glioma cell lines and also stimulated proliferation (assessed as metabolic activity) of HROG36 cells. Migration of C6 cells were also stimulated by PEG-CLP-IKVAV. These responses strongly correlated with the changes in adhesion and morphology parameters of individual cells - projected cell area, cell shape index, and focal contact number. Melanoma A375 cell proliferation was increased by PEG-CLP-RGD, and this was accompanied by a decrease in cell shape index. However, neither RGD nor IKVAV conjugated to PEG-CLP stimulated migratory capacity of A375 cells. Taken together, the study presents synthetic scaffolds with extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking peptides that allow for the exploration of the effect of ECM signaling to cancer cells.

33015040|t|The Golgi Apparatus May Be a Potential Therapeutic Target for Apoptosis-Related Neurological Diseases.
33015040|a|Increasing evidence shows that, in addition to the classical function of protein processing and transport, the Golgi apparatus (GA) is also involved in apoptosis, one of the most common forms of cell death. The structure and the function of the GA is damaged during apoptosis. However, the specific effect of the GA on the apoptosis process is unclear; it may be involved in initiating or promoting apoptosis, or it may inhibit apoptosis. Golgi-related apoptosis is associated with a variety of neurological diseases including glioma, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and ischemic stroke. This review summarizes the changes and the possible mechanisms of Golgi structure and function during apoptosis. In addition, we also explore the possible mechanisms by which the GA regulates apoptosis and summarize the potential relationship between the Golgi and certain neurological diseases from the perspective of apoptosis. Elucidation of the interaction between the GA and apoptosis broadens our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of neurological diseases and provides new research directions for the treatment of these diseases. Therefore, we propose that the GA may be a potential therapeutic target for apoptosis-related neurological diseases.

33015045|t|miR-146a-5p Plays an Oncogenic Role in NSCLC via Suppression of TRAF6.
33015045|a|Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most deadly cancer in the world due to its often delayed diagnosis. Identification of biomarkers with high sensitivity, specificity, and accessibility for early detection, such as circulating microRNAs, is therefore of utmost importance. In the present study, we identified a significantly higher expression of miR-146a-5p in the serum and tissue samples of NSCLC patients than that of the healthy controls. In parallel, miR-146a-5p was also highly expressed in three human NSCLC adenocarcinoma-cell lines (A549, H1299, and H1975) compared to the human bronchial epithelium cell line (HBE). By dual-luciferase reporter assay and manipulation of the expressions of miR-146a-5p and its target gene, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), we showed that the functional effects of miR-146a-5p on NSCLC cell survival and migration were mediated by direct binding to and suppression of TRAF6. Overexpression of TRAF6 sufficiently reversed miR-146a-5p-induced cancer cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis resistance. Our data implied that miR-146a-5p/TRAF6/NF-kappaB-p65 axis could be a promising diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for NSCLC.

33015046|t|CircRNA Is a Rising Star in Researches of Ocular Diseases.
33015046|a|A newly rediscovered subclass of noncoding RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs), is produced by a back-splicing mechanism with a covalently closed loop structure. They not only serve as the sponge for microRNAs (miRNAs) and proteins but also regulate gene expression and epigenetic modification, translate into peptides, and generate pseudogenes. Dysregulation of circRNA expression has opened a new chapter in the etiology of various human disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and ocular diseases. Recent studies recognized the vital roles that circRNAs played in the pathogenesis of various eye diseases, highlighting circRNAs as promising biomarkers for diagnosis and assessment of progression and prognosis. Interventions targeting circRNAs provide insights for developing novel treatments for these ocular diseases. This review summarizes our current perception of the properties, biogenesis, and functions of circRNAs and the development of circRNA researches related to ophthalmologic diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, glaucoma, corneal neovascularization, cataract, pterygium, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinoblastoma, and ocular melanoma.

33015047|t|Cellular Interactions and Inflammation in the Pathogenesis of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma.
33015047|a|Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) comprises a group of lymphoproliferative diseases characterized by the accumulation of malignant T cells in chronically inflamed skin lesions. In early stages, the disease presents as skin patches or plaques covering a limited area of the skin and normally follows an indolent course. However, in a subset of patients the cutaneous lesions develop into tumors and the malignant T cells may spread to the lymphatic system, blood and internal organs with fatal consequences. Despite intensive research, the mechanisms driving disease progression remain incompletely understood. While most studies have focused on cancer cell-intrinsic oncogenesis, such as genetic and epigenetic events driving malignant transformation and disease progression, an increasing body of evidence shows that the interplay between malignant T cells and non-malignant cells plays a crucial role. Here, we outline some of the emerging mechanisms by which tumor, stromal and epidermal interactions may contribute to the progression of CTCL with particular emphasis on the crosstalk between fibroblasts, keratinocytes and malignant T cells.

33015070|t|Endothelial Ribonuclease 1 in Cardiovascular and Systemic Inflammation.
33015070|a|The vascular endothelial cell layer forms the inner lining of all blood vessels to maintain proper functioning of the vascular system. However, dysfunction of the endothelium depicts a major issue in context of vascular pathologies, such as atherosclerosis or thrombosis that cause several million deaths per year worldwide. In recent years, the endothelial extracellular endonuclease Ribonuclease 1 (RNase1) was described as a key player in regulation of vascular homeostasis by protecting endothelial cells from detrimental effects of the damage-associated molecular pattern extracellular RNA upon acute inflammation. Despite this protective function, massive dysregulation of RNase1 was observed during prolonged endothelial cell inflammation resulting in progression of several vascular diseases. For the first time, this review article outlines the current knowledge on endothelial RNase1 and its role in function and dysfunction of the endothelium, thereby focusing on the intensive research from recent years: Uncovering the underlying mechanisms of RNase1 function and regulation in response to acute as well as long-term inflammation, the role of RNase1 in context of vascular, inflammatory and infectious diseases and the potential to develop novel therapeutic options to treat these pathologies against the background of RNase1 function in endothelial cells.

33015077|t|Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Increased Risk of Developing Osteoarthritis: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study in Taiwan.
33015077|a|Objective: To investigate the risk of developing OA in patients diagnosed with RA. Methods: In this study, we presented gender, age, urbanization, occupation and, comorbidities in a RA cohort and a non-RA cohort based on number and percentage. We investigated the OA risk in patients with RA. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a 13-year longitudinal follow-up in Taiwan. Patients who received RA diagnoses between 2000 and 2012 were enrolled in the study cohort. The non-RA cohort were 1:1 propensity score matched with the RA cohort by age, gender, index year, urbanization, occupation, and comorbidities. The hazard ratios (HRs) and adjusted HRs (aHRs) were estimated after confounders were adjusted. Sensitivity analysis utilizing the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) was conducted. Results: We totally enrolled 63,626 cases in RA patients (study cohort) and matched controls. In the RA cohort, the crude HR for OA was 2.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.63-3.11, p < 0.001), and the aHR was 2.75 (95% CI, 2.52-2.99, p < 0.001). (The study demonstrated that patients with RA had a higher risk for developing OA compared with the non-RA controls. Conclusion: Developing effective OA prevention strategies are necessary in patients with RA. This finding may be extended to evaluate the risk of OA among other kinds of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Identifying the key pathogenesis mechanisms are necessary in the future study.

33015082|t|Celastrol Efficacy by Oral Administration in the Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis Model.
33015082|a|Background: We previously demonstrated that celastrol has significant anti-inflammatory and bone protective effects when administered via the intraperitoneal route. For further preclinical evaluation, an effective oral administration of celastrol is crucial. Here we aimed to study the therapeutic dose range for its oral administration. Methods: Celastrol (1-25 mug/g/day, N = 5/group) was administrated orally to female adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats after 8 days of disease induction for a period of 14 days. A group of healthy (N = 8) and arthritic (N = 15) gender- and age-matched Wistar rats was used as controls. During the treatment period, the inflammatory score, ankle perimeter, and body weight were measured. At the end of the treatment, the animals were sacrificed, blood was collected for clinical pathology, necropsy was performed with collection of internal organs for histopathological analysis, and paw samples were used for disease scoring. Results: Doses higher than 2.5 mug/g/day of celastrol reduced the inflammatory score and ankle swelling, preserved joint structure, halted bone destruction, and diminished the number of synovial CD68+ macrophages. Bone resorption and turnover were also reduced at 5 and 7.5 mug/g/day doses. However, the dose of 7.5 mug/g/day was associated with thymic and liver lesions, and higher doses showed severe toxicity. Conclusion: Oral administration of celastrol above 2.5 mug/g/day ameliorates arthritis. This data supports and gives relevant information for the development of a preclinical test of celastrol in the setting of a chronic model of arthritis since rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term disease.

33015085|t|Chinese Herbal Formula Huayu-Qiangshen-Tongbi Decoction Compared With Leflunomide in Combination With Methotrexate in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: An Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Pilot Study.
33015085|a|Background: Traditional Chinese Medicine is complementary and an alternative to modern medicine. The combination therapies of herbal products with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs are gradually and widely adopted in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China. Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Huayu-Qiangshen-Tongbi (HQT) decoction, a Chinese medicine formula, combined with methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of patients with active RA, in comparison with the combination therapy of MTX with leflunomide (LEF). Methods: This pilot study was a monocenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Ninety patients with active RA were randomly allocated to receive either HQT at a dose of 250 ml twice daily or LEF at a dose of 20 mg once daily, and all participants received MTX at a dose of 10-15 mg once weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) after a 24-week treatment. Results: 84.4% (76/90) patients completed the 24-week observation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage values of patients achieving the ACR20 response criteria were 72.1% (31/43) in MTX + HQT group and 74.4% (32/43) in MTX + LEF group (p = 0.808). No significant difference was observed in other parameters, including ACR50, ACR70, clinical disease activity index good responses, European League Against Rheumatism good response, remission rate, and low disease activity rate. The results of the per-protocol analysis showed consistency with those of the intention-to-treat analysis. The mean change from baseline at week 24 for the van der Heijde modified total sharp score had no significant difference between two groups (3.59 +- 4.75 and 1.34 +- 8.67 in the MTX + HQT group and MTX + LEF group, respectively, p = 0.613). The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups (11 cases in the MTX + HQT and 17 cases in the MTX + LEF, p > 0.05). Conclusions: In patients with active RA, treatment with the combination of HQT and MTX was associated with improvement in signs, symptoms, and physical function.

33015102|t|Trend of Survival of a Cohort of Chinese Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Over 25 Years.
33015102|a|Objectives: To revisit the trend of survival of systemic lupus erythematosus in a cohort of Chinese patients over 25 years. Methods: Patients who fulfilled the 1997 ACR criteria for SLE and were followed in our hospital since 1995 were included. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the year of diagnosis: (1) 1995-2004 and (2) 2005-2018. Survival of patients was studied by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Organ damage as assessed by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) damage index (SDI) and causes of death in the first 10 years of SLE onset was compared between the two groups. Cox regression was used to study factors associated with survival. Results: A total of 1,098 SLE patients were registered in our database. After excluding 157 patients diagnosed outside the time period of 1995-2018, 941 patients were studied (92% women). All were ethnic Chinese. The mean age of SLE onset was 35.1 +- 14.4 years, and the mean duration of observation was 13.1 +- 6.6 years. Seventy-seven (8.2%) patients were lost to follow-up. Groups 1 and 2 consisted of 364 and 577 patients, respectively. The mean SDI score at 10 years of disease onset was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2 patients (1.01 +- 1.43 vs. 0.57 +- 0.94; p < 0.01), particularly in the neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, and gonadal domains. Within 10 years of SLE onset, 32 (8.8%) patients in group 1 and 25 (4.3%) patients in group 2 died (p = 0.005). The 5- and 10-year cumulative survival rates were 93.6 and 91.0% in group 1 and 96.5 and 94.2% in group 2 patients, respectively (log-rank test p = 0.048). Infection accounted for more than half of the deaths in both groups. More group 1 than group 2 patients died of vascular events, but the difference was not statistically significant. Cox regression showed that the age of SLE onset and damage score accrued at 10 years, but not the time period in which SLE was diagnosed, were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: The improvement in survival of our SLE patients is probably related to the accrual of less organ damage in the past 15 years.

33015161|t|Comprehensive Analysis of a ceRNA Network Identifies lncR-C3orf35 Associated with Poor Prognosis in Osteosarcoma.
33015161|a|Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant bone cancer which primarily occurs in children and young adults. Increasing evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that sponge microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of cancers. The regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in osteosarcoma have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identified differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in osteosarcoma based on RNA microarray profiles in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A ceRNA network was constructed utilizing bioinformatic tools. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that lncR-C3orf35 and HMGB1 were associated with poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. Furthermore, results of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that lncR-C3orf35 may be involved in cellular invasion, the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Further analysis showed that patients with osteosarcoma metastasis expressed higher levels of lncR-C3orf35 and HMGB1 compared to metastasis-free patients. Moreover, the metastasis-free survival rate of the high lncR-C3orf35/HMGB1 expression group was significantly lower than that of the low expression group. The ESTIMATE algorithm was used to calculate the immune score and stromal scores for each sample. High lncR-C3orf35 and HMGB1 levels were correlated with low immune scores. ImmuCellAI analysis revealed that a low proportion of macrophage infiltration was associated with high lncR-C3orf35 and HMGB1 expression. The differential expression of lncR-C3orf35, miR-142-3p, and HMGB1 was further verified by quantitative real-time PCR. This study indicates that lncR-C3orf35 could be considered as a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target of osteosarcoma, which may contribute to a better understanding of ceRNA regulatory mechanisms.

33015162|t|Arctigenin Inhibits Glioblastoma Proliferation through the AKT/mTOR Pathway and Induces Autophagy.
33015162|a|Purpose: Arctigenin (ARG) is a natural lignan compound extracted from Arctium lappa and has displayed anticancer function and therapeutic effect in a variety of cancers. Arctigenin is mainly from Arctium lappa extract. It has been shown to induce autophagy in various cancers. However, as for whether arctigenin induces autophagy in gliomas or not, the specific mechanism is still worth exploring. Methods: Using CCK8, the monoclonal experiment was made to detect the proliferation ability. The scratch experiment and the transwell experiment were applied to the migration and invasion ability. PI/RNase and FITC-conjugated anti-annexin V were used to detect the cell cycle and apoptosis. Western blotting was used to determine the specified protein level, and constructed LC3B-GFP plasmid was used for analysis of autophagy. Results: Our research showed that ARG inhibited the growth and proliferation and invasion and migration of glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner (U87MG and T98G) and arrested the cell cycle and induced apoptosis. Interestingly, ARG induced autophagy in a dose-dependent manner. We applied Western blotting to measure the increase in the key autophagy protein LC3B, as well as some other autophagy-related proteins (increase in Beclin-1 and decrease in P62). In order to further explore the mechanism that ARG passed initiating autophagy to inhibit cell growth, we further found by Western blotting that AKT and mTOR phosphorylation proteins (P-AKT, P-mTOR) were reduced after ARG treatment, and we used AKT agonists to rescue, and the phosphorylated proteins of AKT and mTOR increased, and we found that the autophagy-related proteins were also reversed. And interestingly, the protein of apoptosis was also reversed along with autophagy. Conclusions: We thought ARG inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells by inducing autophagy and apoptosis through the AKT/mTOR pathway.

33015172|t|circHIPK3 Acts as Competing Endogenous RNA and Promotes Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Progression through the miR-107/BDNF Signaling Pathway.
33015172|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) act as a crucial part in many human diseases, particularly in cancers. circRNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3) is a special circRNA that may participate in the oncogenesis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), even though its latent regulatory mechanism is not very clear. Here, we studied the roles of circHIPK3 in NSCLC. qRT-PCR assay was applied to study the expression of circHIPK3 in NSCLC. The influence of circHIPK3 on NSCLC was estimated by silencing circHIPK3 and miR-107 mock transfection and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) overexpression, and the correlation between circHIPK3, miR-107, and BDNF was evaluated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that circHIPK3 expression was upregulated in NSCLC cells. circHIPK3 knockdown inhibited the migration and proliferation of NSCLC cells by promoting the expression of miR-107. circHIPK3 could be used as a miR-107 sponge to promote BDNF cell proliferation. The dual-luciferase reporter assay proved that miR-107 was the target of circHIPK3, and miR-107 had an interaction with the 3'untranslated region of BDNF. miR-107 overexpression inhibited BDNF-mediated NSCLC cell proliferation. These results indicate that circHIPK3 promotes tumor progression through a new circHIPK3/miR-107/BDNF axis, which offers potential markers and medical treatment for NSCLC.

33015173|t|Patient-Reported Outcomes of Arsenic-Related Skin Lesions in China.
33015173|a|Purpose: Previous studies confirmed that chronic arsenic exposure could lead to pigmentary changes and hyperkeratosis. However, skin health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people under lifetime arsenic exposure remains underappreciated. Our study is aimed at investigating several patient-reported outcomes in a population under chronic arsenic exposure. Patients and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in communities in Shimen, China. Dermatologists performed skin examinations for participants. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included HRQoL, itch, sleep quality, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was used to measure skin HRQoL. The numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to measure the intensity of itching. Sleep disturbance was measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Anxiety and depression were measured by two-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), respectively. Results: A total of 464 participants suffering from arsenic-related skin lesions finished the assessment of DLQI. Pigmentary changes and arsenical keratosis were not associated with the patient-reported outcomes except PHQ-2. Hair arsenic exceeding 1 mug/g was associated with higher itch NRS and DLQI (P < 0.05). Itch NRS (adjusted beta = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70-0.90, P < 0.01) and hair arsenic concentration (adjusted beta = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.01-0.24, P < 0.05) were independently associated with the DLQI. Conclusion: HRQoL, sleep quality, and mental wellbeing are impaired in residents under chronic arsenic exposure. Itching and hair arsenic are independent risk factors for impaired HRQoL.

33015175|t|MAGE-Targeted Gold Nanoparticles for Ultrasound Imaging-Guided Phototherapy in Melanoma.
33015175|a|Gold nanorods exhibit a wide variety of applications such as tumor molecular imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) due to their tunable optical properties. Several studies have demonstrated that the combination of other therapeutic strategies may improve PTT efficiency. A method called optical droplet vaporization (ODV) was considered as another noninvasive imaging and therapy strategy. Via the ODV method, superheated perfluorocarbon droplets can be vaporized to a gas phase for enhancing ultrasound imaging; meanwhile, this violent process can cause damage to cells and tissue. In addition, active targeting through the functionalization with targeting ligands can effectively increase nanoprobe accumulation in the tumor area, improving the sensitivity and specificity of imaging and therapy. Our study prepared a nanoparticle loaded with gold nanorods and perfluorinated hexane and conjugated to a monoclonal antibody (MAGE-1 antibody) to melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE) targeting melanoma, investigated the synergistic effect of PTT/ODV therapy, and monitored the therapeutic effect using ultrasound. The prepared MAGE-Au-PFH-NPs achieved complete eradication of tumors. Meanwhile, the MAGE-Au-PFH-NPs also possess significant ultrasound imaging signal enhancement, which shows the potential for imaging-guided tumor therapy in the future.

33015284|t|A case of hyperpigmentation induced by hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and review of the literature.
33015284|a|Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) and quinacrine are widely used antimalarials for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. We report a case of antimalarial-induced hyperpigmentation in a 57-year old African-American woman. The patient had a long-standing history of SLE that was treated with HQ and quinacrine in varying doses for 16 years. The disease improved considerably and entered remission; however, the patient subsequently developed severe, disseminated hyperpigmentation on her face, trunk, upper and lower extremities. A malar facial biopsy revealed numerous perivascular and scattered interstitial, heavily pigment laden dark brown to black macrophages. The Fontana Masson staining was positive for melanin, and Perl's stain for iron was negative. This staining pattern, to our knowledge, has only been reported once before in the literature. Our patient represents a rare case of severe recalcitrant hyperpigmentation induced by combination HQ and quinacrine therapy for SLE.

33015288|t|Sex-based differences in the anatomic distribution of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
33015288|a|Background: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common malignancy in the United States, and its incidence is increasing. Ultraviolet radiation is the main environmental risk factor for cSCCs; thus, they tend to arise on sun-exposed skin. Most publications cite the head and neck as the predominant location for cSCCs, but these papers do not account for the differential anatomic predication of cSCCs by sex. No prior studies have examined the differential distribution of cSCCs by sex, particularly invasive cSCCs that have the potential for recurrence and metastasis. Objective: We examined the association between cSCC tumor features, including anatomic site and invasiveness, by key patient features, including age and sex. Methods: Using an institutional cSCC registry, we identified 618 non-Hispanic white patients diagnosed with 2,111 histologically-confirmed cSCCs between 2000-2016. Results: We found differential anatomic distributions of cSCC by patient sex. Men were more likely to have cSCCs arise on the head and neck (51.7%), whereas women were more likely to have cSCCs develop on the lower extremity (41.2%). Stratification by dichotomized age (younger [<65 years] vs. older [>=65 years]) revealed that nearly half of invasive cSCCs (47.7%) among older women arose on the lower extremities, whereas approximately half of the invasive cSCCs (52.4%) arose on the head and neck among older men. Conclusion: Lower extremities can be easily overlooked, particularly when practitioners perform waist-up-only skin examinations in time-limited settings. Understanding the anatomic predilection for invasive cSCCs by patient characteristics, including our findings, which suggest that the lower extremities are an important anatomic site for invasive cSCCs among women, can help further inform skin cancer screening and prevention efforts.

33015309|t|An approach to classifying subjective cognitive decline in community-dwelling elders.
33015309|a|Introduction: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may be an early symptomatic manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, though published research largely neglects how to classify SCD in community-based studies. Methods: In neuropsychologically intact Einstein Aging Study participants (n = 1115; mean age = 78; 63% female; 30% non-White), we used Cox models to examine the association between self-perceived cognitive functioning at baseline (using three different approaches) and incident amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with covariates of age, sex, education, race/ethnicity, general (objective) cognition, depressive symptoms, and four other SCD-related features. Results: After a median of 3 years, 198 participants developed aMCI. In models that included all the variables, self-perceived cognitive functioning was consistently associated with incident aMCI as were age, general cognition, and perceived control; apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele status was significant in one model. We set cut points that optimized the diagnostic accuracy of SCD at various time frames. Discussion: We provide an approach to SCD classification and discuss implications for cognitive aging studies.

33015310|t|Depression screening in cognitively normal older adults: Measurement bias according to subjective memory decline, brain amyloid burden, cognitive function, and sex.
33015310|a|Introduction: Understanding the associations among depression, subjective cognitive decline, and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) has important implications for both depression and dementia screening in older adults. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a depression screening tool for older adults that queries memory concerns. To determine whether depression symptoms on the GDS (15-item version), including self-reported memory problems, differ by levels of brain amyloid beta (Abeta), a pathological hallmark of early stage AD, we investigated potential measurement bias with regard to Abeta level. We also examined measurement bias attributable to level of cognitive functioning and sex as positive controls. Methods: We examined 3961 cognitively normal older adults from the A4/LEARN Study. We used the MIMIC (multiple indicators, multiple causes) approach to detect measurement bias. Results: We found measurement bias with small-to-moderate range effect sizes in several GDS-15 items with respect to Abeta level, cognitive functioning, and sex. There was negligible impact of measurement bias attributable to Abeta level on overall depressive symptom level. Discussion: GDS-15 item responses are sensitive to Abeta burden, cognitive functioning, and sex over and above what would be expected given the effect of those factors on depressive symptom severity overall. However, these direct effects for GDS item measurement bias are of small magnitude and do not appreciably impact the validity of inferences about depression based on the GDS-15.

33015311|t|Sectoral segmentation of retinal amyloid imaging in subjects with cognitive decline.
33015311|a|Introduction: Despite advances in imaging retinal amyloidosis, a quantitative and topographical investigation of retinal amyloid beta burden in patients with cognitive decline has never been reported. Methods: We used the specific amyloid-binding fluorophore curcumin and laser ophthalmoscopy to assess retinal amyloid imaging (RAI) in 34 patients with cognitive decline. We automatically quantified retinal amyloid count (RAC) and area in the superotemporal retinal sub-regions and performed correlation analyses with cognitive and brain volumetric parameters. Results: RAC significantly and inversely correlated with hippocampal volume (HV; r = -0.39, P = .04). The proximal mid-periphery (PMP) RAC and RA areas were significantly greater in patients with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score < 26 (P = .01; Cohen d = 0.83 and 0.81, respectively). PMP showed significantly more RAC and area in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to cognitively normal (P = .04; Cohen d = 0.83). Conclusion: Quantitative RAI is a feasible technique and PMP RAC may predict HV. Future larger studies should determine RAI's potential as a biomarker of early AD.

33015363|t|How does race and ethnicity effect the precision treatment of asthma?
33015363|a|Introduction: Asthma is a common condition that affects large numbers of children and adults, yet the burden of disease is not equally distributed amongst groups. In the United States, African Americans and Puerto Ricans have higher rates of asthma and its complications when compared with European Americans. However, clinical trials and genetic studies have largely focused on the latter group. Areas covered: Here we examine what is known regarding differences in asthma treatment response by race-ethnicity. We also review existing genetic studies related to the use of asthma medications, paying special attention to studies that included substantial numbers of non-white population groups. Publicly accessible search engines of the medical literature were queried using combinations of the terms asthma, race, ethnicity, pharmacogenomics, and pharmacogenetics, as well as the names of individual asthma medication classes. The list of articles reviewed was supplemented by bibliographies and expert knowledge. Expert opinion: A substantial and coordinated effort is still needed to both identify and validate genetic biomarkers of asthma medication response, as currently there are no clinically actionable genetic markers available for this purpose. The path to identifying such markers in non-white populations is even more formidable, since these groups are underrepresented in existing data.

33015383|t|Investigating genetic drivers of dermatomyositis pathogenesis using meta-analysis.
33015383|a|Aims: Dermatomyositis (DM) is a progressive, idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with poorly understood pathogenesis. A hallmark of DM is an increased risk for developing breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. Since autoantibodies against anti-TIF-1-gamma, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, has a strong association with malignancy, we examined expression of the TRIM gene family to identify pathways that may be contributing to DM pathogenesis. Materials and methods: We employed the Search Tag Analyze Resource for GEO platform to search the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus to elucidate TRIM family gene expression as well as oncogenic drivers in DM pathology. We conducted meta-analysis of the data from human skin (60 DM vs 34 healthy) and muscle (71 DM vs 22 healthy). Key findings: We identified genes involved in innate immunity, antigen presentation, metabolism, and other cellular processes as facilitators of DM disease activity and confirmed previous observations regarding the presence of a robust interferon signature. Moreover, analysis of DM muscle samples revealed upregulation of TRIM14, TRIM22, TRIM25, TRIM27, and TRIM38. Likewise, analysis of DM skin samples showed upregulation of TRIM5, TRIM6, TRIM 14, TRIM21, TRIM34, and TRIM38 and downregulation of TRIM73. Additionally, we noted upregulation of oncogenes IGLC1, IFI44, POSTN, MYC, NPM1, and IDO1 and related this change to interferon signaling. While the clinical data associated with genetic data that was analyzed did not contain clinical data regarding malignancy in these cohorts, the observed genetic changes may be associated with homeostatic and signaling changes that relate to the increased risk in malignancy in DM. Significance: Our results implicate previously unknown genes as potential drivers of DM pathology and suggest certain TRIM family members may have disease-specific roles with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

33015527|t|Genomic Alterations as Potential Therapeutic Targets in Extramammary Paget's Disease of the Vulva.
33015527|a|PURPOSE: To identify genomic alterations as potential therapeutic targets in extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) of the vulva. METHODS: We identified all patients with primary vulvar EMPD who were treated at our institution and underwent paired tumor-normal massively parallel sequencing of 410-468 cancer-related genes (MSK-IMPACT assay). EMPD of the vulva samples sequenced from 2014 to 2019 were reviewed and somatic mutations identified, with specific focus on mutations of potential therapeutic targets. Clinical data were abstracted from electronic medical records. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was assessed by MSIscore. RESULTS: Tumors of 26 patients with EMPD underwent genomic sequencing. At diagnosis, all patients had noninvasive or microinvasive (< 1 mm) disease; invasive disease eventually developed in 2 patients. Primary treatment was surgery for 19 patients (73%) and imiquimod topical therapy for 7 (27%). Seven patients had >= 2 surgeries as part of clinical course (1 patient had 5 vulvar resections). Samples had a median of 2 coding mutations in the genes analyzed (range, 0-29). The most common mutations were in PIK3CA (n = 9; 35%), ERBB2 (4 mutations and 3 copy number alterations; 27%), and TP53 (n = 7; 27%). MSIscore was available for 23 samples; all were microsatellite stable. After tumor genomic profiling, a patient who was initially treated with multiple resections and imiquimod was found to have a PIK3CA p.E542K mutation. She underwent PI3K-inhibitor treatment for 18 months before disease progression. CONCLUSION: EMPD of the vulva has a chronic and relapsing course, often requiring multiple surgical resections. Effective topical treatments are lacking. We identified targetable mutations (PIK3CA or ERBB2) in > 25% of a real-world clinical cohort. Additional prospective research implementing targetable therapies for EMPD treatment is warranted.

33015528|t|Undetectable RAS-Mutant Clones in Plasma: Possible Implication for Anti-EGFR Therapy and Prognosis in Patients With RAS-Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
33015528|a|PURPOSE: Combining cetuximab with chemotherapy provides clinical benefit to 60% of the patients with RAS wild-type (RAS-wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This pilot study investigated the efficacy of cetuximab-based chemotherapy in a sample of patients (40%) with RAS mutation (RAS-mt) in their primary tumor whose circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was RAS-wt. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The occurrence of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), and PI3KCA mutations was determined in ctDNA by using a new ultrasensitive analysis based on mass spectrometry detection. All consenting patients with confirmed RAS-mt mCRC had disease progression on previous chemotherapy that contained no anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The patients with RAS-wt ctDNA received cetuximab + fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI), whereas those with RAS-mt ctDNA were treated with the oncologist's choice of therapy. RESULTS: Of 16 registered patients, 11 were male and five female. They were age 48 to 81 years, and they had unresectable metastatic adenocarcinoma from the colon (n = 11) or rectum (n = 5), with a median of two metastatic sites. They had received a median number of three previous chemotherapy protocols. Plasma genotyping identified RAS-mt in seven patients (44%) and RAS-wt in nine patients (56%). In the patients with wt ctDNA, objective tumor response rate was 50.0%, including one complete response and four partial responses after a median number of 6 courses of cetuximab + FOLFIRI (range, 1 to 16 courses). Two of the nine patients had stable disease, and two had progressive disease. No grade 3 to 4 toxicities were encountered. One-year survival rates were 60.0% for the patients with RAS-wt ctDNA and 17.9% for those with RAS-mt ctDNA. Median overall survival times were not reached and 4.7 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with RAS-mt mCRC whose plasma biopsies contained RAS-wt could benefit from cetuximab-based therapy, a hypothesis to be tested in a prospective randomized trial.

33015533|t|CDKN2C-Null Leiomyosarcoma: A Novel, Genomically Distinct Class of TP53/RB1-Wild-Type Tumor With Frequent CIC Genomic Alterations and 1p/19q-Codeletion.
33015533|a|PURPOSE: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) harbors frequent mutations in TP53 and RB1 but few actionable genomic alterations. Here, we searched for recurrent actionable genomic alterations in LMS that occur in the absence of common untreatable oncogenic drivers. METHODS: Tissues from 276,645 unique advanced cancers, including 2,570 uterine and soft tissue LMS, were sequenced by hybrid-capture-based next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing/comprehensive genomic profiling of up to 406 genes. We characterized clinicopathologic features of relevant patient cases. RESULTS: Overall, 77 LMS exhibited homozygous copy loss of CDKN2C at chromosome 1p32.3 (3.0% of LMS). Genomic alterations (GAs) in TP53, RB1, and ATRX were rare compared with the remainder of the LMS cohort (11.7% v 73.4%, 0% v 54.5%, 2.6% v 24.5%, respectively; all P < .0001). CDKN2C-null LMS patient cases were significantly enriched for GAs in CIC (40.3% v 1.4%) at 19q13.2, CDKN2A (46.8% v 7.0%), and RAD51B (16.9% v 1.7%; all P < .0001). Chromosome arm-level aneuploidy analysis of available LMS patient cases (n = 1,284) found that 81% (58 of 72) of CDKN2C-null LMS exhibited 1p/19q-codeletion, a significant enrichment compared with 5.1% in the remainder of the LMS cohort (P < .0001). In total, 99% of CDKN2C-null LMS were in women; the median age was 61 years at surgery (range, 36-81 years). Fifty-five patient cases were uterine primary, four were nonuterine, and the remaining 18 were of uncertain primary site. Sixty percent of cases showed at least focal epithelioid variant histology. Most patients had advanced-stage disease, with 62% of confirmed uterine primary LMS at International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IVB. We further validated our findings in two publicly available datasets: The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Project GENIE initiative. CONCLUSION: CDKN2C-null LMS defines a genomically distinct tumor that may have prognostic and/or therapeutic clinical implications, including possible use of specific cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.

33015599|t|cDC1 are required for the initiation of collagen-induced arthritis.
33015599|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is chronic autoimmune disease which etiology remains unknown. Several cell types have been described to potentiate/aggravate the arthritic process however the initiating event in synovial inflammation is still elusive. Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential for the initiation of primary immune responses and thus we hypothesized that these cells might be crucial for RA induction. DCs are a heterogeneous population of cells comprising different subsets with distinct phenotype and function. Here we investigated which DC subset(s) is/are crucial for the initiation of the arthritic process. We have previously demonstrated that Flt3-/- mice, with reduced DCs, were protected from collagen induced arthritis (CIA). Here we have shown that GM-CSF derived DCs in Flt3L-/- mice are functional but not sufficient to induce arthritis. Batf3-/- mice lacking both CD103+ and CD8alpha+ cDC1 were resistant to collagen induced arthritis (CIA), demonstrating that this DC subset is crucial for arthritis development. CEP-701 (a Flt3L inhibitor) treatment prevented CIA induction, and reduced dramatically the numbers CD103+ cDC1s present in the lymph nodes and synovium. Hence this study identified cDC1 as the main subset orchestrating the initiation of cell-mediated immunity in arthritis.

33015616|t|New variants in NLRP3 inflammasome genes increase risk for asthma and Blomia tropicalis-induced allergy in a Brazilian population.
33015616|a|Atopic asthma is a chronic lung disease of lower airways caused mainly due to action of T-helper (Th) 2 type cytokines, eosinophilic inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and airway remodelling. Interleukin (IL)-33 increases type 2 immunity polarization in airway playing critical role in eosinophilic asthma. On the other hand, NLRP3 inflammasome activation results in the release of caspase-1 (Casp-1) which, in its turn, promotes IL-33 inactivation. Recent studies have shown associations between NLRP3 variants and inflammatory diseases. However, no study with genes in NLRP3 inflammassome route has been conducted so far with asthma and atopy in any population to date. Blood samples were collected from 1246 asthmatic and non-asthmatic children. Associations were tested for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s in NLRP3 and CASP1 with asthma and markers of atopy and in cultures stimulated with Blomia tropicalis (Bt) mite crude extract. The T allele of rs4925648 (NLRP3) was associated with increased asthma risk (OR 1.50, P = 0.005). In addition, the T allele of rs12130711 polymorphism, whithin the same gene, acted as a protector factor for asthma (OR 0.78, P = 0.038). On the other hand, the C allele of rs4378247 NLRP3 variant was associated with lower levels of IL-13 production when peripheral blood cells were stimulated with Bt (OR 0.39, P = 4E-04). In addition, the greater the number of risk alleles in IL33/NLRP3/CASP1 route the greater was the risk for asthma. The T allele of rs7925706 CASP1 variant was also associated with increased risk for asthma (OR 1.47, P = 0.008). In addition, this same allele increased the eosinophil counts in blood (mm3) in asthmatic individuals compared with non-asthmatic (P = 0.0004). These results suggest that NLRP3 and CASP1 polymorphisms may be associated with susceptibility for asthma and markers of atopy in our population.

33015617|t|Enhancing efficacy of gemcitabine in pancreatic patient-derived xenograft mouse models.
33015617|a|Gemcitabine (Gem), a nucleoside analog, is a preferred choice of treatment for pancreatic cancer (PCa) and often used in combination therapy against wide range of solid tumors. It is known to be rapidly inactivated in blood by cytidine deaminase. The objective of the study was to improve the systemic stability and anticancer activity of modified Gem termed 4-N-stearoylGem (4NSG) In this study, the IC50 values of 4NSG treated MiaPaCa-2 and primary pancreatic cancer (PPCL-46) cultures were significantly lower when compared with gemcitabine hydrochloride (GemHCl) treated cultures. In acute toxicity study, liver enzyme level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of the control mice was not significantly different from AST levels of 4NSG and GemHCl treated mice. However, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of control mice (67 +- 5 mUnits/mL) was significantly lower compared with ALT levels of GemHCl (232 +- 28 mUnits/mL) and that of 4NSG (172 +- 22 mUnits/mL) (p < 0.0001). More importantly, ALT level of 4NSG was lower than ALT level of GemHCl (p < 0.05). Although ALT levels were elevated, pathological images of liver and kidney tissues of control, GemHCl and 4NSG treated mice revealed no architectural changes and no significant change in mice weight was observed during treatment. The bioavailability (AUC) of 4NSG was 3-fold high and significantly inhibited the tumor growth as compared with equivalent dose of GemHCl. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that 4NSG significantly inhibited the expression vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor. The study is unique because it established, for the first time, enhanced anticancer activity of 4NSG against pancreatic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model and PPCL-46 cells compared with Gem. 4SGN enhanced pharmacokinetic profile and improved the therapeutic efficacy of the standard-of-care Gem. Lastly, 4GSN showed a remarkable tumor growth inhibition and revealed significant antiangiogenic activity in 4GSN treated pancreatic PDX tumor.

33015624|t|Regulation and pharmacological targeting of RAD51 in cancer.
33015624|a|Regulation of homologous recombination (HR) is central for cancer prevention. However, too little HR can increase cancer incidence, whereas too much HR can drive cancer resistance to therapy. Importantly, therapeutics targeting HR deficiency have demonstrated a profound efficacy in the clinic improving patient outcomes, particularly for breast and ovarian cancer. RAD51 is central to DNA damage repair in the HR pathway. As such, understanding the function and regulation of RAD51 is essential for cancer biology. This review will focus on the role of RAD51 in cancer and beyond and how modulation of its function can be exploited as a cancer therapeutic.

33015682|t|Advances in epithelial ovarian cancer.
33015682|a|BACKGROUND: Most epithelial ovarian cancer occurs in older women, with a mean age at diagnosis of 62 years and an overall five-year survival rate in Australia of 43%. Most women are diagnosed with advanced disease of high-grade serous type with 20-30% five-year survival; 70% relapse within three years of initial treatment. There is no available screening test for ovarian cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to highlight current management and future directions for women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer, particularly the high incidence of underlying genetic mutations and new options for treatment. DISCUSSION: Risk-reducing surgery with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended for women at high risk of developing ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer treatment still centres on surgery and chemotherapy, with aggressive cytoreductive techniques and intraperitoneal treatments being evaluated in advanced disease. Molecular targeting agents are revolutionising treatment options, particularly the poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, and especially for patients with an underlying BRCA mutation. Other molecular targeting agents, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitors and newer approaches using immunotherapy and molecular targeting, aim to individualise treatment and improve survival in the future.

33015707|t|Associations of Self-reported Obstructive Sleep Apnea with Total and Site-specific Cancer Risk in Older Women: A Prospective Study.
33015707|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic intermittent hypoxia resulting from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may activate multiple carcinogenic pathways and lead to cancer development. METHODS: We prospectively examined the association between OSA and cancer risk among 65,330 women in the Nurses' Health Study who were free of cancer in 2008 (mean age: 73.3 years). Incident cancer diagnoses were collected until 2016 and confirmed by pathology reports. Clinically-diagnosed OSA was self-reported in 2008 and updated in 2012. We used time-dependent Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for the associations of OSA with total and site-specific cancer risk. RESULTS: We documented 5,257 incident cancer diagnoses during follow-up. In the age-adjusted model, OSA was associated with a 15% (95% CI: 1.03, 1.29) increase in total cancer risk. The association became non-significant after adjustment for multiple cancer risk factors (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.21). When examining cancer risk by site, OSA was associated with significantly increased risk for lung (fully-adjusted HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.17), bladder (fully-adjusted HR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.35) and thyroid cancer (fully-adjusted HR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 4.22) and possibly increased risk for kidney cancer (fully-adjusted HR: 1.59; 95% CI: 0.84, 3.01). When grouping cancer sites by risk factor profiles, OSA was positively associated with smoking-related cancers (fully-adjusted HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.67), and this association was stronger in never smokers than ever smokers. CONCLUSION: While OSA was not independently associated with overall cancer risk in older women, significant associations were observed for smoking-related cancers, especially in non-smokers.

33015716|t|Tim-3 promotes tube formation and decreases tight junction formation in vascular endothelial cells.
33015716|a|As a negative immune checkpoint molecule, T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain containing molecule-3 (Tim-3) has been found to serve a crucial role in immune escape and tumour progression. Previous studies have reported that Tim-3 is important to endothelial cells and it has also been demonstrated to be involved in numerous types of human disease, including melanoma, lymphoma, rickettsial infection and atherosclerosis; however, its exact mechanism of action remains largely unknown. In the present study, Tim-3 was overexpressed in vascular endothelial HMVECs and HUVECs and in vitro assays were used to determine that Tim-3 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation through activating cyclin D1, Ras homolog gene family member A and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Additionally, Tim-3 decreased tight junction (TJ) formation and the transepithelial resistance of endothelial cells by decreasing the expression levels of TJ protein 2, Occludin and claudin 1. In conclusion, these findings suggested that Tim-3 may exert a positive role in angiogenesis and a negative role in TJ formation in vascular endothelial cells, which may provide novel strategies for the treatment of Tim-3 associated diseases.

33015765|t|Sirt7 protects chondrocytes degeneration in osteoarthritis via autophagy activation.
33015765|a|OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with decreased autophagy activity and imbalance of cell homeostasis in chondrocytes (CHs). Sirtuin 7 (Sirt7) is claimed to have the ability to activate the autophagy response. The aim of this study was to explore the function of Sirt7 in the development of OA involving autophagy by culturing human chondrocytes (CHs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected knee joint cartilage from patients undergoing traumatic amputation and arthroscopic knee replacement. Protein and mRNA levels of collagen II, Sirt7, ULK1, Lc3, and Beclin1 were analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR. CHs were isolated from the traumatic cartilage as a control group, and IL-1beta was used to induce CHs degeneration. The expression of Sirt7 gene was silenced by siRNA and upregulated by recombinant human Sirt7 protein (rh-Sirt7). An autophagy activator Tat-beclin 1 (Tat) was used to activate autophagy in cultural CHs. Expression of collagen II, Sirt7, ULK1, Lc3, and Beclin1 was determined by immunofluorescence, Western blot, and RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: The protein and mRNA levels of Collagen II, Sirt7, ULK1, Lc3-II, and Beclin1 expressions were decreased in OA cartilage compared with those in healthy cartilage. IL-1beta degenerated the CHs resulting in a reduction of collagen II, which also downregulated Sirt7, ULK1, Lc3-II, and Beclin1. Sirt7 deficiency accelerated the catabolism of collagen II and weakened the expression of ULK1, Lc3-II, and Beclin1. On the contrary, exogenous rh-Sirt7 played a positive role in these gene expressions. Finally, Tat alleviated the CHs degeneration by upregulating collagen II and activating ULK1, Lc3-II, and Beclin1, but incapable to mediate Sirt7 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings suggested that Sirt7 was suppressed in the degenerated cartilage. Sirt7 deficiency does harm to the autophagy level, affecting CHs metabolism, while the upregulation of Sirt7 activated autophagy and protected CHs degeneration. An appropriate increase in autophagy can protect CHs but has no effect on Sirt7 expression.

33015769|t|LncRNA SNHG17 promotes proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells through up-regulating FOXA1.
33015769|a|OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the specific mechanism through which long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG17 promotes the proliferative capacity and invasiveness of ovarian tumor cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) detected the expressions of SNHG17 and FOXA1 in 30 pairs of ovarian cancer tissue specimens and corresponding adjacent ones. Meanwhile, in ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, OVCAR3, SKOV3, CAOV3) and normal ovarian epithelial cell line (IOSE80), SNHG17 and FOXA1 mRNA levels were also examined. In in vitro experiment, si-SNHG17, si-FOXA1, and their corresponding negative controls were transfected into ovarian cancer cell lines, respectively. After that, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and plate cloning experiments were carried out to examine cell proliferation ability, while transwell assay was performed for cell invasiveness detection. Lastly, the interplay between SNHG17 and FOXA1 was further assessed via qRT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: qRT-PCR results indicated that SNHG17 expression was remarkably enhanced in ovarian cancer tissue samples compared with that in adjacent ones. In addition, ovarian cancer cells also contained higher expression of SNHG17 than the normal ovarian epithelial cells. However, down-regulating SNHG17 attenuated the cell proliferation and invasive ability. At the same time, compared with that in adjacent tissue samples, FOXA1 also showed a higher expression in ovarian cancer tissues, which was positively correlated with SNHG17. Silencing SNHG17 markedly downregulated FOXA1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, downregulation of FOXA1 expression was found to be able to inhibit cell proliferation and invasion as well. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA SNHG17 can promote ovarian tumor cell proliferative ability and invasiveness by upregulating FOXA1, and serve as a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

33015782|t|LncRNA FAM83A-AS1 aggravates the malignant development of esophageal cancer by binding to miR-495-3p.
33015782|a|OBJECTIVE: It is of significance to screen out differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can be utilized as tumor biomarkers in esophageal cancer. This study aims to uncover the effect of lncRNA FAM83A-AS1 on regulating migratory potential in esophageal cancer and the underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor tissues and adjacent normal ones were collected from 62 esophageal cancer patients for detecting FAM83A-AS1 levels. Correlations of FAM83A-AS1 with clinical indexes and overall survival of esophageal cancer patients were analyzed. Thereafter, regulatory effects of FAM83A-AS1 on migratory potential in OE19 and OE33 cells were examined by transwell and wound healing assay. Then, the target genes of FAM83A-AS1 were predicted and functionally analyzed, and a protein interaction network was constructed. Finally, the mechanism of FAM83A-AS1 in regulating the downstream gene miR-495-3p was analyzed through Luciferase assay and rescue experiments. RESULTS: It was found that FAM83A-AS1 was upregulated in esophageal cancer tissues and cell lines. Higher rates of lymphatic and distant metastasis and worse survival were observed in esophageal cancer patients expressing higher level of FAM83A-AS1. Besides, the knockdown of FAM83A-AS1 suppressed migratory potential in OE19 cells, while the overexpression of FAM83A-AS1 yielded the opposite trend in OE33 cells. Moreover, miR-495-3p was indicated to be the target gene binding FAM83A-AS1, and it was lowly expressed in esophageal cancer and negatively regulated by FAM83A-AS1. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-495-3p partially abolished the regulatory effect of FAM83A-AS1 on migratory potential in esophageal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: FAM83A-AS1 is upregulated in esophageal cancer, and it stimulates migratory potential in esophageal cancer by negatively regulating miR-495-3p.

33015800|t|Long non-coding RNA SUMO1P3 promotes glioma progression via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.
33015800|a|OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNA SUMO1P3 has been reported to act as an oncogene in the tumorigenesis of several types of human malignancy. However, to the best of our knowledge, the exact biological functions and potential mechanism of lncRNA SUMO1P3 in glioma remains unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of SUMO1P3 in glioma and to explore the underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study examined SUMO1P3 expression in glioma tissues and cell lines using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assays were used to examine the effects of SUMO1P3 on the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells, respectively. Furthermore, Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of proteins in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. RESULTS: The expression level of SUMO1P3 was higher in glioma tissues compared with corresponding adjacent normal tissues. In addition, a high expression level of SUMO1P3 was significantly associated with clinical progression and poor survival for patients with glioma. Furthermore, the knockdown of SUMO1P3 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of U87 and U251 cells. In addition, the knockdown of SUMO1P3 inhibits glioma growth in vivo. Finally, the knockdown of SUMO1P3 inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduced the expression levels of active beta-catenin, C-myc, and cyclin D1 in U87 and U251 cells. By contrast, the overexpression of SUMO1P3 promoted glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSIONS: SUMO1P3 promotes glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and may be involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

33015801|t|Long non-coding RNA LINC00346 regulates proliferation and apoptosis by targeting miR-128-3p/SZRD1 axis in glioma.
33015801|a|OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in multiple processes of malignant tumors, including glioma. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of LINC00346 on glioma and its underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases were used to analyze the expression patterns and survival risk of LINC00346, miR-128-3p and SUZ RNA binding domain containing 1 (SZRD1) in glioma tissues. The binding sites were predicted by bioinformatic databases, and then, validated by Dual-Luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to evaluate the gene expression levels. CellTiter-Glo  and colony formation assays were used to detect the proliferation of glioma cells. Flow cytometric analysis was used to evaluate the apoptosis of glioma cells. The xenograft models were established to investigate the impact of LINC00346 on tumor growth in vivo. RESULTS: We found that both LINC00346 and SZRD1 expression were negatively related to the poor overall survival rate in glioma patients. However, miR-128-3p showed the opposite effect of survival outcomes. LINC00346 knockdown remarkably restrained cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, as well as inducing apoptosis by acting as a molecular sponge of miR-128-3p. Moreover, miR-128-3p bound to SZRD1 3'-UTR in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, LINC00346 knockdown significantly inhibited the expression of SZRD1 and the inhibition could be reversed by miR-128-3p mimics. Furthermore, cell proliferation and apoptosis affected by LINC00346 were partially rescued by modulating miR-128-3p or SZRD1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: LINC00346/miR-128-3p/SZRD1 axis played a crucial role in modulating the malignant progression of glioma, which may serve as a prognostic indicator and a probable therapeutic target for glioma.

33015807|t|Knockdown of NEAT1 mitigates ox-LDL-induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells via miR-30c-5p/TCF7 axis.
33015807|a|OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerosis is an inflammation-associated disease resulting in a huge health hazard. Abundance of researches showed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) played vital roles in atherosclerosis, but the molecular mechanism of nuclear-enriched abundant transcript (NEAT1) has not been fully elucidated yet. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) for constructing the model of atherosclerosis. The detection of NEAT1, microRNA-30c-5p (miR-30c-5p), and transcription factor 7 (TCF7) expression was implemented by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry, respectively. The levels of apoptosis-associated proteins were examined through Western blot and the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The targeted relationship was analyzed by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: NEAT1 was upregulated in serum of patients with atherosclerosis and HUVECs treated with ox-LDL. Knockdown of NEAT1 exerted the promotion of proliferation but suppression of apoptosis and inflammation in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs. Moreover, NEAT1 targeted miR-30c-5p and the overexpression of miR-30c-5p reversed the ox-LDL-induced effects in HUVECs. Furthermore, miR-30c-5p directly refrained the TCF7 level, and NEAT1 repression decreased the expression of TCF7 by upregulating miR-30c-5p. The knockdown of NEAT1 afforded the protective effect for HUVECs treated with ox-LDL through miR-30c-5p/TCF7 axis. CONCLUSIONS: The knockdown of NEAT1 overtly motivated proliferation but alleviated the apoptosis and inflammation in ox-LDL-treated HUVECs by miR-30c-5p/TCF7 axis. NEAT1 accelerated the progression of atherosclerosis therapies, functioning as an indicative element.

33015814|t|The first case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) triggered by COVID-19 infection.
33015814|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The acute phase may be followed by a second phase actually not yet completely understood but probably associated to an autoimmune activation. At the moment is not possible to clearly define an association between immunological findings and pathological symptoms, however, this case report describes the case of a patient who following COVID-19 infection development autoimmune antibodies who persist in time longer than viral phase. Those antibodies can be responsible for the multi pathological clinical picture showed from our patient that, according to EULAR 2019 criteria, could be classified as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is probably one of the possible chronic rheumatologic diseases triggers by COVID-19 and this is the first case of SLE with vasculitis actually described in literature.

33015878|t|Reverse radiodorsal artery-pedicled thumb metacarpal vascularized bone graft for osteochondral fracture of the thumb interphalangeal joint with a bone defect: A case report.
33015878|a|Osteochondral fractures of the fingers are challenging to treat, and it is mandatory to acquire early bone union and joint surface reconstruction to obtain satisfactory outcomes. These injuries sometimes occur as open fractures with poor soft tissue condition and bone defect adjacent to osteochondral fragment. For such cases, surgical treatment can be more difficult, and vascularized bone graft (VBG) could be a useful method for joint reconstruction. Here, we report reverse-pedicled VBG based on the radiodorsal artery of the thumb for reconstructing a traumatic bone defect of the thumb. A 36-year-old man, who had ulcerative colitis and was taking immunosuppressive agents, sustained open fracture-dislocation of the thumb interphalangeal joint with a free osteochondral fragment of the proximal phalanx and 6 x 5 x 4 mm of subcondylar bone defect. We harvested 5 x 5 x 5 mm VBG at the base of the first metacarpal bone and dissected running the radiodorsal artery. The vascularized bone was grafted into the bone defect site through the subcutaneous tunnel created on the radial aspect of the proximal phalanx and fixed with a Kirschner wire. Bony union was obtained 2 months after surgery. At 7 months after the operation, the patient complained no pain, and the range of motion of the thumb interphalangeal joint was extension 0  and flexion 42 . Radiographs showed no avascular necrosis of the united fragment and osteoarthritis of the interphalangeal joint. This method could be a useful option for reconstruction of the thumb with bone defects.

33015890|t|The impact of edema and fiber crossing on diffusion MRI metrics assessed in an ex vivo nerve phantom: Multi-tensor model vs. diffusion orientation distribution function.
33015890|a|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been employed for over 2 decades to noninvasively quantify central nervous system diseases/injuries. However, DTI is an inadequate simplification of diffusion modeling in the presence of coexisting inflammation, edema and crossing nerve fibers. We employed a tissue phantom using fixed mouse trigeminal nerves coated with various amounts of agarose gel to mimic crossing fibers in the presence of vasogenic edema. Diffusivity measures derived by DTI and diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) were compared at increasing levels of simulated edema and degrees of fiber crossing. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of DBSI, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), q-ball imaging (QBI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging to resolve fiber crossing, in reference to the gold standard angles measured from structural images. DTI-computed diffusivities and fractional anisotropy were significantly confounded by gel-mimicked edema and crossing fibers. Conversely, DBSI calculated accurate diffusivities of individual fibers regardless of the extent of simulated edema and degrees of fiber crossing angles. Additionally, DBSI accurately and consistently estimated crossing angles in various conditions of gel-mimicked edema when compared with the gold standard (r2 = 0.92, P = 1.9 x 10-9 , bias = 3.9 ). Small crossing angles and edema significantly impact the diffusion orientation distribution function, making DKI, GQI and QBI less accurate in detecting and estimating fiber crossing angles. Lastly, we used diffusion tensor ellipsoids to demonstrate that DBSI resolves the confounds of edema and crossing fibers in the peritumoral edema region from a patient with lung cancer metastasis, while DTI failed. In summary, DBSI is able to separate two crossing fibers and accurately recover their diffusivities in a complex environment characterized by increasing crossing angles and amounts of gel-mimicked edema. DBSI also indicated better angular resolution compared with DKI, QBI and GQI.

33015913|t|Extreme skeletal muscle loss during induction chemotherapy is an independent predictor of poor survival in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients.
33015913|a|AIM: Skeletal muscle loss is often observed in advanced cancer patients. This study investigates whether skeletal muscle loss is associated with survival outcomes of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients after induction chemotherapy (IC) in a Japanese cohort. Whether serum inflammatory markers are associated with skeletal muscle changes is also addressed. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 60 patients with stage III/IV EOC who underwent IC between 2010 and 2017. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) was measured at the third lumbar vertebrae level on a single axial computed tomography-scan image. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to determine cut-off values of pre- and post-IC SMA and SMA ratio (SMAR). Univariate and multivariate analyses of overall survival (OS) were conducted using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression model, respectively. RESULTS: The SMA decreased significantly after IC (P = 0.019). The cut-off value between low and high SMAR was 0.96. High or low SMAR was observed in 34 (57%) and 26 (43%) patients, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that low SMAR was associated with poor OS (P = 0.025). Multivariate analysis showed that incomplete resection during interval debulking surgery (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P = 0.016) and a low SMAR (hazard ratio, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.18-9.06; P = 0.022) were independent predictors of poor OS. Of the serum inflammatory markers investigated, only post-IC absolute neutrophil count correlated significantly with SMAR (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Low SMAR can be used to predict poor prognosis in advanced EOC patients who have undergone IC.

33015933|t|Patient preferences for treatment of advanced melanoma: impact of comorbidities.
33015933|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Choice of treatment for advanced melanoma is crucially influenced by comorbidities and patient preferences. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of comorbidities on preferences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 150 patients with melanoma stage IIC-IV completed a discrete choice experiment to determine preferences for outcome (overall response rate [ORR], 2-year survival, progression-free survival [PFS], time to response [TTR], kind of adverse events [AE], AE-related treatment discontinuation) and process attributes (frequency and route of administration [RoA], frequency of consultations) of systemic melanoma treatments. The impact of comorbidities was assessed by analysis of variance and multivariate regression. RESULTS: Participants with hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases attached significantly greater importance to TTR and RoA than others. Respondents with arthropathy cared more about TTR (beta = 0.179, P = 0.047) and RoA, but less about ORR (beta = -0.209, P =  0.021). Individuals with diabetes considered AE (beta = 0.185, P = 0.039) and frequency of consultations more essential, but ORR less relevant. Those with other malignancies were particularly worried about treatment discontinuation (beta = 0.219, P =  0.008), but less about ORR (beta = -0.202, P =  0.015). Participants with depression focused more on PFS (beta = 0.201, P =  0.025) and less on TTR (beta = -0.201, P =  0.023) and RoA (beta = -0.167, P =  0.050). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment preferences of melanoma patients vary significantly dependent on comorbidities.

33015961|t|Targeted Delivery of Cell Softening Micelles to Schlemm's Canal Endothelial Cells for Treatment of Glaucoma.
33015961|a|Increased stiffness of the Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelium in the aqueous humor outflow pathways has been associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. Novel treatments that relax this endothelium, such as actin depolymerizers and rho kinase inhibitors, are in development. Unfortunately, these treatments have undesirable off-target effects and a lower than desired potency. To address these issues, a targeted PEG-b-PPS micelle loaded with actin depolymerizer latrunculin A (tLatA-MC) is developed. Targeting of SC cells is achieved by modifying the micelle surface with a high affinity peptide that binds the VEGFR3/FLT4 receptor, a lymphatic lineage marker found to be highly expressed by SC cells relative to other ocular cells. During in vitro optimization, increasing the peptide surface density increased micellar uptake in SC cells while unexpectedly decreasing uptake by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The functional efficacy of tLatA-MC, as measured by decreased SC cell stiffness compared to non-targeted micelles (ntLatA-MC) or targeted blank micelles (tBL-MC), is verified using atomic force microscopy. tLatA-MC reduced IOP in an in vivo mouse model by 30-50%. The results validate the use of a cell-softening nanotherapy to selectively modulate stiffness of SC cells for therapeutic reduction of IOP and treatment of glaucoma.

33015987|t|Prognostic Significance of Thrombomodulin mRNA in High-Grade Soft Tissue Sarcomas after 10 years.
33015987|a|OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the correlation between expression of thrombomodulin (TM) mRNA from 83 benign soft tissue tumors or soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and clinicopathological parameters and to analyze the outcome of high-grade STS patients after 10 years. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from 83 primary soft tissue tumors (15 benign tumors, 68 STS). TM mRNA normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was measured with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and compared to various clinicopathological parameters. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard analysis were used to evaluate recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: Thrombomodulin mRNA levels were not significantly different between benign tumors and STS. In STS, TM mRNA levels were not significantly different between histologically high-grade (n = 57) and low-grade (n = 11) tumors. Following analysis of high-grade STS at the 10-year follow-up, 21 patients had experienced a recurrence, 22 patients had experienced metastasis, and 23 patients had died of disease (DOD). TM levels were significantly higher in patients with metastasis or DOD patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for identifying 5-year and 10-year DOD determined the threshold for best sensitivity and specificity as 0.283. We divided patients into those with high (<0.283) and low (<=0.283) TM mRNA levels. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, a significant difference between the two groups was seen for recurrence-free survival (5 years: low = 76.6%, high = 53.1%, 10 years: low: 67.0%, high 39.8%, P = 0.0122) and metastasis-free survival (5 years: low = 86.3%, high = 40.2%, 10 years: low: 73.3%, high: 35.2%, P = 0.00023). Furthermore, the high TM group showed significantly worse prognosis than the low TM group (5 years: low = 90.1%, high = 42.3%, 10 years: low: 76.4%, high 31.3%, P = 0.00031). Thus, high levels of TM mRNA are associated with highly recurrent and metastatic potential and lead to poor prognosis. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, only high TM showed a significant difference in metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio: 4.33, 95% confidence interval 1.61-11.6, P = 0.00359) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 3.69, 95% confidence interval 1.49-10.5, P = 0.00569). CONCLUSION: High levels of TM mRNA may be a significant predictor of recurrence, metastasis, and a poor outcome in STS patients after 10 years. TM is a candidate molecular marker and may be clinically useful for devising a therapeutic treatment strategy by prediction of prognosis.

33015988|a|BACKGROUND: A relationship between the EGFR signaling pathway expression in skin and the use of targeted cancer therapies has been previously demonstrated. Consistent evidence to support the use of skin biopsies as a surrogate for therapeutic evaluation is needed. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between the expression of EGFR signaling pathway markers in skin samples from EGFR-mutated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma patients and their response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: This was a prospective single blind analysis of 35 skin biopsies from 31 patients with confirmed advanced EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed: EGFR, p27, Ki67, STAT3 and MAPK, as well as H&E histopathological analysis, in order to determine their treatment response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RESULTS: EGFR, Ki67, STAT3, stratum corneum thickness (number of layers and millimeters) from skin samples had a statistical correlation with an adequate treatment response (P = 0.025, 0.015, 0.017, 0.041, 0.039 respectively). EGFR, p27 and number of layers of the stratum corneum were related to a better median progression-free survival (P = 0.025 and P = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between EGFR pathway inhibition in the skin and oncological outcomes obtained explains the parallel biological effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We hope that our work incites future research to help validate and assess the use of these markers as potential prognostic and predictive factors.

33016042|t|Bone pain palliation outcomes and possibility of Radium-223 re-treatment in mCRPC.
33016042|a|OBJECTIVE: Bone secondary localizations from metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer are associated with an increase in mortality and a reduction in the patient's quality of life. Radium-223 is a targeted alpha-therapy approved for the treatment of mCRPC (metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer) patients with symptomatic bone metastases. To our knowledge, no previous study has been performed assessing the bone pain palliation outcomes following Radium-223 therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mCRPC patient with symptomatic bone localizations and relevant bone pain symptoms has been subjected to Radium-223 treatment. Pain was assessed over time from the first administration of Radium-223 to follow-up. RESULTS: After Radium-223 treatment, patient showed a significant BPI (Brief Pain Inventory) decline from 7 to 4 and a concomitant partial regression of multiple bone hot spots in the bone scan exam. Three months after the last infusion of Radium-223, further BPI decline (from 4 to 2) with bone scan depicting stable disease was observed. However, after 6 months from Radium-223 treatment end, BPI increased from 2 to 10. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the effectiveness on bone pain relief and the low toxicity profile showed by Radium-223 treatment, we encourage further analysis on large cohort to investigate the clinical outcome after Radium-223 treatment, in terms of bone pain palliation, together with the possibility of Radium-223 re-treatment in selected patients..

33016047|t|Expression of miR-132 and miR-212 in prostate cancer and metastatic lymph node: Case report and revision of the literature.
33016047|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that act as key regulators in various physiological and pathological processes as prostate cancer (PCa). In this study we describe molecular evaluation of 132 and 212 miRNAs expression, by Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), in a Caucasian man 64-year-old with locally advanced PCa (PSA 160 ng/ml, Gleason score 4+3/ISUP Grade Group 3, clinical stage T3NXM0) who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy plus extended pelvic lymphadenectomy (LAD) as first step of a multimodal therapeutic treatment. A normal prostate of a 67-year-old man removed by post mortem autopsy was used as a control in the study. The mRNA for this study was conducted on paraffined prostatic sections of: a) index case of PCa; b) metastatic lymph node of index case; c) normal prostate. MiRNA-132, miRNA- 212 and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (as reference gene) assays were obtained. Definitive specimen showed a pT3bN1R1 stage: acinar cells adenocarcinoma with involvement of the seminal vesicles, multifocal positive surgical margins, Gleason score 8 (4+4/ISUP Grade Group 4), metastases in 5/25 iliac lymph nodes. An increased expression of miRNA-132 and miRNA-212 in index case of prostatic adenocarcinoma compared to normal prostate tissue was found; moreover, a lower expression of miR-132 and miR-212 in metastatic lymph node compared to primitive PCa and normal prostate tissue was demonstrated. Although a greater number of patients should be evaluated, these data suggest that the biology of the primary PCa, in our clinical case, was different from metastatic lymph node.

33016048|t|Primary small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder: Case report and literature review.
33016048|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are extremely rare and aggressive. Although they commonly affect intestine, many organs may be involved such as pancreas, lung or urinary tract. Bladder is rarely involved. Actually, two main forms of bladder NET have been described: small-cell and large-cell. The first one is considered highly agressive since it shows poor oncologic outcomes being mainly diagnosed at advanced stage: the second one is extremely rare and equally aggressive. CASE REPORT: A 78-years-old Caucasian male presented to our facility for lower urinary tract symptoms and gross hematuria recently occurred. He was a strong smoker since many years. No familiarity for urothelial cancer was referred nor previous episodes of hematuria until that time. Citology was negative; outpatient ultrasound of the bladder revealed a 3 cm bladder thickening highly suspicious for bladder cancer; patient underwent TC scan that confirmed the bladder lesion. A transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) was performed. After 3 months total body TC showed multiple visceral metastases also involving brain and lymph nodes. Best supportive care was offered but the patient died 6 months later. RESULTS: Pathology revealed a mixed bladder tumor: 30% of the specimen resulted as an high-grade urothelial cancer (G3) and 70% as small-cell neuroendocrine variant.Microscopic muscle involvement was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendocrine tumors are uncommon entities which origin from cells of neuro-endocrine system and may potentially involve all human tissues. Neuroendocrine smallcell carcinoma of the bladder is a non-urothelial histotype: it is highly aggressive and diagnosed mainly at advanced stages. Whenever considering the high risk of metastatic spread and the poor prognosis, a multimodal approach is highly suggested. TURB alone is uneffective in disease control due to its aggressive nature. Unless metastatic, radical cystectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy represent the gold standard.

33016054|t|Prostate cancer with cribriform pattern: Exclusion criterion for active surveillance?
33016054|a|INTRODUCTION: Following the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology meeting, a rapidly growing body of evidence by several researchers has been demonstrating a poor prognosis in association with cribriform morphology. The aim of our study was to describe the presence of cribriform foci in specimens of radical prostatectomies and to evaluate whether demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with the presence of cribriform pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study was based on 70 radical retropubic prostatectomies specimens collected between 2012 and 2016 and evaluated for the association of the cribriform pattern with age, prostate-specific antigen at surgery day, Gleason on biopsy, Gleason after radical prostatectomy, extracapsular extension, vesicles invasion, margins, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and post-operative radiotherapy. Results; From the univariable analysis, biochemical prostatespecific antigen recurrence (p = 0.001), extracapsular extension (p = 0.003), pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (p = 0.017), vesicles invasion, (p = 0.038) and post-operative radiotherapy (p < 0.001) showed an association with the presence of cribriform pattern. There was also a significant difference of cribriform pattern and Gleason 7 in needle biopsy (p = 0.020) and cribriform pattern and Gleason 8 or 9 in radical prostatectomy specimen (p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the increase in preoperative prostate-specific antigen had a high association with cribriform pattern. Further evidence is needed to discriminate preoperative prostate specific antigen values that might potentially be associated with the presence of cribriform pattern. Raising our knowledge about the cribriform pattern can be an excellent opportunity to correctly identify and treat patients who will eventually die from prostate cancer, sparing treatment in those who will not.

33016104|t|Antidiabetic Effects and Mechanisms of Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) and its Phenolic Components.
33016104|a|Diabetes mellitus is a chronic endocrine disease result from absolute or relative insulin secretion deficiency, insulin resistance, or both, and has become a major and growing public healthy menace worldwide. Currently, clinical antidiabetic drugs still have some limitations in efficacy and safety such as gastrointestinal side effects, hypoglycemia, or weight gain. Rosmarinus officinalis is an aromatic evergreen shrub used as a food additive and medicine, which has been extensively used to treat hyperglycemia, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetic wounds. A great deal of pharmacological research showed that rosemary extract and its phenolic constituents, especially carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, and carnosol, could significantly improve diabetes mellitus by regulating glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation, exhibiting extremely high research value. Therefore, this review summarizes the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms of rosemary extract and its primary phenolic constituents on diabetes and relative complications both in vitro and in vivo studies from 2000 to 2020, to provide some scientific evidence and research ideas for its clinical application.

33016114|t|Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes: A Potential Therapeutic Avenue in Knee Osteoarthritis.
33016114|a|Knee osteoarthritis is the leading cause of functional disability in adults. The goals of knee osteoarthritis management are directed toward symptomatic pain relief along with the attainment of the functional quality of life. The treatment strategy ranges from conservative to surgical management with reparative and restorative techniques. The emergence of cell-based therapies has paved the way for the usage of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in cartilage disorders. Currently, global researchers are keen on their research on nanomedicine and targeted drug delivery. MSC-derived exosomes act as a directed therapy to halt the disease progression and to provide a pain-free range of movements with increased quality of cartilage on regeneration. International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and the European Network on Microvesicles and Exosomes in Health and Disease have formed guidelines to foster the use of the growing therapeutic potential of exosomal therapy in osteoarthritis. Although regenerative therapies with MSC are being seen to hold a future in the management of osteoarthritis, extracellular vesicle-based technology holds the key to unlock the potential toward knee preservation and regeneration. The intricate composition and uncertain functioning of exosomes are inquisitive facets warranting further exploration.

33016145|t|Effect of smoking on oncological outcome among prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.
33016145|a|We analyzed the association between smoking and oncological outcome after radical prostatectomy with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. This study included men who had undergone radical prostatectomy with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy between 2003 and 2016. We evaluated the association between clinicopathological factors and smoking status as well as the prognostic significance of smoking status in biochemical recurrence. The patients' backgrounds were comparable between smokers and nonsmokers. Smoking status were identified as significant risk factors of biochemical recurrence. Smoking was a risk factor of biochemical recurrence, suggesting that smoking may promote cancer recurrence after surgical treatment combined with hormonal therapy.

33016151|t|How should a physician approach the pharmacological management of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension?
33016151|a|INTRODUCTION: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterized by the presence of organized thromboembolic material and proliferative fibrous intima occluding varying degrees of the pulmonary arteries, and is also accompanied by small vessel vasculopathy in occluded and non-occluded pulmonary vasculature. The similarity in hemodynamics and pathophysiology between CTEPH and group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension provides the rationale for clinical use of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-specific therapy. AREAS COVERED: The authors present the current knowledge concerning the updated therapeutic strategies in CTEPH, and try to illustrate the established and uncertain role of PAH-specific therapy and anticoagulation therapy. The real-world observational registries and landmark randomized controlled trials of PAH-specific drugs in CTEPH are emphasized in the manuscript. EXPERT OPINION: Despite surgical and interventional therapies, which could provide effective and potential curable treatments, medical therapies are still the substantial and irreplaceable option for patients with CTEPH. More and more PAH-specific drugs have demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety profiles in patients with CTEPH. Additionally, anticoagulation therapy is also a substantial medical treatment in all CTEPH patients without contradiction. However, the benefit-to-risk balance in life-long anticoagulation and whether more individualized anticoagulation strategies are needed warrants further investigation.

33016190|t|Peripheral Artery Disease in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Survival Analysis of an Ecuadorian Population in Primary Care.
33016190|a|BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is used for diagnosis of PAD. OBJECTIVES: Establish the prevalence and incidence rate for PAD and determine the associated factors and survival time for the development of PAD. METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional cohort study (follow up: 10 years) in 578 DM patients with at least 1 ABI measurement in a primary level of care diabetes clinic. Data was collected from clinical records. Sociodemographic and laboratory variables were analyzed determining its association (mean difference and bivariate logistic regression). Survival was calculated through life tables and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of PAD was 13.98%. The incidence rate through the time of follow up was 23.38 per 1000 person-year (95% CI: 19.91-27.26). The group that developed PAD showed higher glycated hemoglobin levels (P = .025), more years of DM (P < .001) and lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR, P = .003). The median time for developing PAD was 26.97 years (95% CI: 26.89-27.05). The risk for PAD was higher in females (95% CI: 1.51-4.38), GFR <60 mL/min/m2 (95% CI: 1.05-2.22) and use of metformin plus insulin (95% CI: 1.10-2.35). CONCLUSION: Half of a DM patient's population in primary level of care will develop PAD in the third decade of disease. There are identifiable risk factors for PAD development in DM in the primary level of care such as low GFR, female sex, and use of metformin plus insulin.

33016197|t|Cerebral artery dissection secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome: A report of two cases and a literature review.
33016197|a|INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thromboembolic events, including ischemic stroke or complications in pregnancy, and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Cervical artery dissection (CAD) is not an uncommon cause of stroke in young adults. The concomitant presence of APS and CAD is extremely rare. METHODS: Two cases with APS who developed acute ischemic strokes related to CAD are reported. A comprehensive systematic literature search using the PubMed database was also conducted. RESULTS: In Case 1, a 36-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and had been repeatedly positive for lupus anticoagulant tests developed an ischemic stroke caused by a vertebral artery dissection (VAD). After admission, she had a recurrent ischemic stroke, followed by considerable changes in steno-occlusive lesions of the vertebrobasilar artery system. In Case 2, a 36-year-old man developed multiple brain infarcts due to bilateral VAD with aneurysmal formations and associated with pulmonary embolism. The anticardiolipin antibody titer was repeatedly elevated after stroke. The literature review identified 8 patients with CAD associated with APS, involving the internal carotid artery in 6 patients and the middle cerebral artery and vertebral artery in 1 patient each. The patients were predominantly young and female, infrequently had atherosclerotic vascular risk factors, and were positive for various antiphospholipid antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The current report described two rare cases of ischemic stroke caused by CAD secondary to APS, along with a review of the literature; the patients displayed characteristic clinical manifestations, implying specific mechanisms for cerebral artery disorders secondary to APS.

33016198|t|Autoimmune thyroid diseases, autoimmune hepatitis, celiac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus: Results from the CARRA Legacy Registry.
33016198|a|OBJECTIVE: Polyautoimmunity (PA) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is reported as a poor prognostic factor, but little is known about its effect in childhood-onset SLE (cSLE). We describe PA in cSLE within the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Legacy Registry and evaluate its association to lupus disease outcomes. METHODS: CARRA Legacy Registry is the largest pediatric rheumatology registry that collected data at enrollment and every 6 months thereafter. We describe the co-occurrence of selected autoimmune disorders (autoimmune thyroid diseases, autoimmune hepatitis, celiac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus) in cSLE. To assess outcomes, we studied measures of lupus disease activity, complications, and patient's quality of life (QoL). Comparisons by PA status were made using chi-square, Fisher's exact test, two-sample t-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and mixed effects models as appropriate. RESULTS: 1285 patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE. Of those, 388 (30%) had data on comorbidity. The prevalence of PA was 8.8%. Patients with PA reported more hospitalizations and aggressive immunotherapy use. SLEDAI and PGA scores improved over time, but did not differ by PA status. No significant differences were found in QoL measures or their trajectory over time by PA status. CONCLUSION: In cSLE, PA is associated with more hospitalizations and aggressive immunotherapy use. Although lupus disease activity improved over time, patients' QoL neither improved over time nor differed by having other autoimmune disease. Prospective, case-control, long-term follow-up studies on cSLE are needed to validate our results.

33016233|t|Peat smoke inhalation alters blood pressure, baroreflex sensitivity, and cardiac arrhythmia risk in rats.
33016233|a|Wildland fires (WF) are linked to adverse health impacts related to poor air quality. The cardiovascular impacts of emissions from specific biomass sources are however unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the cardiovascular impacts of a single exposure to peat smoke, a key regional WF air pollution source, and relate these to baroreceptor sensitivity and inflammation. Three-month-old male Wistar-Kyoto rats, implanted with radiotelemeters for continuous monitoring of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), were exposed once, for 1-hr, to filtered air or low (0.38 mg/m3 PM) or high (4.04 mg/m3) concentrations of peat smoke. Systemic markers of inflammation and sensitivity to aconitine-induced cardiac arrhythmias, a measure of latent myocardial vulnerability, were assessed in separate cohorts of rats 24 hr after exposure. PM size (low peat = 0.4-0.5 microns vs. high peat = 0.8-1.2 microns) and proportion of organic carbon (low peat = 77% vs. high peat = 65%) varied with exposure level. Exposure to high peat and to a lesser extent low peat increased systolic and diastolic BP relative to filtered air. In contrast, only exposure to low peat elevated BRS and aconitine-induced arrhythmogenesis relative to filtered air and increased circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, complement components C3 and C4, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and white blood cells. Taken together, exposure to peat smoke produced overt and latent cardiovascular consequences that were likely influenced by physicochemical characteristics of the smoke and associated adaptive homeostatic mechanisms.

33016243|t|Naturally Acquired Mouse Kidney Parvovirus Infection Produces a Persistent Interstitial Nephritis in Immunocompetent Laboratory Mice.
33016243|a|Mouse kidney parvovirus (MKPV), also known as murine chapparvovirus (MuCPV), is an emerging, highly infectious agent that has been isolated from laboratory and wild mouse populations. In immunocompromised mice, MKPV produces severe chronic interstitial nephropathy and renal failure within 4 to 5 months of infection. However, the course of disease, severity of histologic lesions, and viral shedding are uncertain for immunocompetent mice. We evaluated MKPV infections in CD-1 and Swiss Webster mice, 2 immunocompetent stocks of mice. MKPV-positive CD-1 mice (n = 30) were identified at approximately 8 weeks of age by fecal PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and were subsequently housed individually for clinical observation and diagnostic sampling. Cage swabs, fecal pellets, urine, and blood were evaluated by PCR at 100 and 128 days following the initial positive test, which identified that 28 of 30 were persistently infected and 24 of these were viremic at 100 days. Histologic lesions associated with MKPV in CD-1 (n = 31) and Swiss mice (n = 11) included lymphoplasmacytic tubulointerstitial nephritis with tubular degeneration. Inclusion bodies were rare; however, intralesional MKPV mRNA was consistently detected via in situ hybridization within tubular epithelial cells of the renal cortex and within collecting duct lumina. In immunocompetent CD-1 mice, MKPV infection resulted in persistent shedding of virus for up to 10 months and a mild tubulointerstitial nephritis, raising concerns that this virus could produce study variations in immunocompetent models. Intranuclear inclusions were not a consistent feature of MKPV infection in immunocompetent mice.

33016246|t|Comparative Pathology of the Peripheral Nervous System.
33016246|a|The peripheral nervous system (PNS) relays messages between the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the body. Despite this critical role and widespread distribution, the PNS is often overlooked when investigating disease in diagnostic and experimental pathology. This review highlights key features of neuroanatomy and physiology of the somatic and autonomic PNS, and appropriate PNS sampling and processing techniques. The review considers major classes of PNS lesions including neuronopathy, axonopathy, and myelinopathy, and major categories of PNS disease including toxic, metabolic, and paraneoplastic neuropathies; infectious and inflammatory diseases; and neoplasms. This review describes a broad range of common PNS lesions and their diagnostic criteria and provides many useful references for pathologists who perform PNS evaluations as a regular or occasional task in their comparative pathology practice.

33016248|t|Oral Lesions in Captive Nondomestic Felids With a Focus on Odontogenic Lesions.
33016248|a|Odontogenic lesions are well described in domestic cats, but published literature describing these lesions in nondomestic felids is limited. This study reports oral lesions in 109 captive, non-domestic felids. Ten cases of odontogenic lesions were diagnosed, including 9 with fibromatous epulis of periodontal ligament origin (FEPLO) and one odontogenic cyst in a cougar. FEPLO was common in lions. FEPLO did not recur after surgical removal in any of the 3 cases for which follow-up information was available. Increased occurrences of oral papillomas in snow leopards and eosinophilic granulomas in tigers were identified, which is consistent with the reported literature. With the exception of oral papillomas in snow leopards and FEPLO in lions, the spectrum of oral lesions in nondomestic felids was similar to what is reported in domestic cats, with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common oral malignancy, and stomatitis/gingivitis/glossitis accounting for approximately one third of all cases. Rare diagnoses with one case each included hemangioma, fibrosarcoma, melanoma, cleft palate, and glossal amyloidosis.

33016285|t|Brimonidine-LAPONITE  intravitreal formulation has an ocular hypotensive and neuroprotective effect throughout 6 months of follow-up in a glaucoma animal model.
33016285|a|Intravitreal administration is widely used in ophthalmological practice to maintain therapeutic drug levels near the neuroretina and because drug delivery systems are necessary to avoid reinjections and sight-threatening side effects. However, currently there is no intravitreal treatment for glaucoma. The brimonidine-LAPONITE  formulation was created with the aim of treating glaucoma for extended periods with a single intravitreal injection. Glaucoma was induced by producing ocular hypertension in two rat cohorts: [BRI-LAP] and [non-bri], with and without treatment, respectively. Eyes treated with brimonidine-LAPONITE  showed lower ocular pressure levels up to week 8 (p < 0.001), functional neuroprotection explored by scotopic and photopic negative response electroretinography (p = 0.042), and structural protection of the retina, retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell layer (p = 0.038), especially on the superior-inferior axis explored by optical coherence tomography, which was corroborated by a higher retinal ganglion cell count (p = 0.040) using immunohistochemistry (Brn3a antibody) up to the end of the study (week 24). Furthermore, delayed neuroprotection was detected in the contralateral eye. Brimonidine was detected in treated rat eyes for up to 6 months. Brimonidine-LAPONITE  seems to be a potential sustained-delivery intravitreal drug for glaucoma treatment.

33016307|t|How to approach adult patients with asymptomatic esophageal eosinophilia.
33016307|a|As the awareness among gastroenterologists regarding endoscopic features suggesting eosinophilic esophagitis is increasing, individuals without symptoms of esophageal dysfunction are increasingly being found to have esophageal eosinophilia on biopsies performed during upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. However, the course of disease and the management of these asymptomatic individuals with esophageal eosinophilia remain elusive. In this review, we propose a definition of asymptomatic individuals with esophageal eosinophilia and discuss the prevalence, risk factors, and course of disease of this specific patient group.

33016313|t|Brain angiotensin converting enzyme-2 in central cardiovascular regulation.
33016313|a|The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions, and maintains cardiovascular homeostasis. Ang-II is the major effector molecule of RAS and exerts most of its physiological functions, including blood pressure (BP) regulation, via activation of AT1 receptors. Dysregulation of brain RAS in the central nervous system results in increased Ang-II synthesis that leads to sympathetic outflow and hypertension. Brain angiotensin (Ang) converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) was discovered two decades ago as an RAS component, exhibiting a counter-regulatory role and opposing the adverse cardiovascular effects produced by Ang-II. Studies using synthetic compounds that can sustain the elevation of ACE2 activity or genetically overexpressed ACE2 in specific brain regions found various beneficial effects on cardiovascular function. More recently, ACE2 has been shown to play critical roles in neuro-inflammation, gut dysbiosis and the regulation of stress and anxiety-like behaviors. In the present review, we aim to highlight the anatomical locations and functional implication of brain ACE2 related to its BP regulation via modulation of the sympathetic nervous system and discuss the recent developments and future directions in the ACE2-mediated central cardiovascular regulation.

33016334|t|Genome-wide mutation analysis in precancerous lesions of endometrial carcinoma.
33016334|a|Clinicopathological evidence supports endometrial atypical hyperplasia (AH) or endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia as the precursor of uterine endometrioid carcinoma (EC), the most common gynecologic malignancy. However, the pathogenic progression from AH to EC remains unclear. Here, we employed whole-exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations and copy number changes in micro-dissected lesions from 30 pairs of newly diagnosed AH and EC. We found that all but one pair of AHs shared the same DNA mismatch repair status as their corresponding ECs. The percentage of common mutations between AH lesions and corresponding ECs varied significantly, ranging from 0.1% to 82%. Microsatellite stable AHs had fewer cancer driver mutations than ECs (5 versus 7, p=0.017), but among microsatellite unstable AHs and ECs there was no difference in mutational numbers (36 versus 38, p=0.65). As compared to AH specimens, 19 (79%) of 24 microsatellite stable EC tumors gained new cancer driver mutations, most of which involved PTEN, ARID1A, PIK3CA, CTNNB1, or CHD4. Our results suggest that some AH lesions are the immediate precursor of ECs, and progression depends on acquisition of additional cancer driver mutations. However, a complex clonal relationship between AH and EC can also be appreciated, as in some cases both lesions diverge very early or arise independently, thus co-developing with distinct genetic trajectories. Our genome-wide profile of mutations in AH and EC shines new light on the molecular landscape of tumor progression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

33016371|t|Aged Tmem106b knockout mice display gait deficits in coincidence with Purkinje cell loss and only limited signs of non-motor dysfunction.
33016371|a|Genetic variants in TMEM106B are a major risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases including frontotemporal degeneration, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, Parkinson`s disease, late-onset-Alzheimer`s disease and constitute a genetic determinant of differential aging. TMEM106B encodes an integral lysosomal membrane protein but its precise physiological function in the central nervous system remains enigmatic. Presently, we aimed to increase understanding of TMEM106B contribution to general brain function and aging. We analyzed an aged cohort of Tmem106b knockout-, heterozygote and wildtype mice in a behavioral test battery including assessments of motor function as well as , social, emotional and cognitive function. Aged Tmem106b knockout (KO) mice displayed diverse behavioral deficits including motor impairment, gait defects and reduced startle reactivity. In contrast, no prominent deficits were observed in social, emotional or cognitive behaviors. Histologically, we observed late-onset loss of Purkinje cells followed by reactive gliosis in the cerebellum, which likely contributed to progressive decline in motor function and gait defects in particular. Reactive gliosis was not restricted to the cerebellum but observed in different areas of the brain including the brain stem and parts of the cerebral cortex. Surviving Purkinje cells showed vacuolated lysosomes in the axon initial segment, implicating TMEM106B-dependent lysosomal trafficking defects as the underlying cause of axonal and more general neuronal dysfunction contributing to behavioral impairments. Our experiments help to elucidate how TMEM106B affects spatial neuronal homeostasis and exemplifies a critical role of TMEM106B in neuronal cells for survival.

33016473|t|Pre-screening of patient-reported symptoms using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System in outpatient palliative cancer care.
33016473|a|OBJECTIVES: Although early palliative care is associated with a better quality of life and improved outcomes in end-of-life cancer care, the criteria of palliative care referral are still elusive. METHODS: We collected patient-reported symptoms using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) at the baseline, first and second follow-up visits. A total of 71 patients were evaluable, with a median age of 65 years, male (62%) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status distribution of 1/2/3 (28%/39%/33%) respectively. RESULTS: Twenty (28%) patients had moderate/severe symptom burden with the mean ESAS >= 5. Interestingly, most of the patients with moderate/severe symptom burdens (ESAS >= 5) had globally elevated symptom expression. While the mean ESAS score was maintained in patients with mild symptom burden (ESAS < 5; 2.7 at the baseline; 3.4 at the first follow-up; 3.0 at the second follow-up; p = .117), there was significant symptom improvement in patients with moderate/severe symptom burden (ESAS >= 5; 6.5 at the baseline; 4.5 at the first follow-up; 3.6 at the second follow-up; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, advanced cancer patients with ESAS >= 5 may benefit from outpatient palliative cancer care. Pre-screening of patient-reported symptoms using ESAS can be useful for identifying unmet palliative care needs in advanced cancer patients.

33016517|t|Examining the effects of individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic status/wealth on hypertension among women in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana.
33016517|a|Hypertension is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Although research on the relationship between individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) and hypertension exists, to the best of our knowledge, limited empirical studies examined the effects of neighbourhood-level SES/wealth on the risks of living with hypertension in Ghana. Using data from the 2009 Women's Health Study of Accra (WHSA-II), and applying multilevel logistic regression, this study investigates the effects of both individual and neighbourhood wealth status on hypertension among women in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. The results show that individual-level SES/wealth is a significant determinant of hypertension among Ghanaian women in Accra. Specifically, wealthy women are more likely to be hypertensive compared to poorer women. However, the effect of neighbourhood SES/wealth was attenuated after adjusting for individual-level SES/wealth. These findings suggest that it is important to develop health promotion programs targeted at a segment of SES group in the prevention, control and management of hypertension among women in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana.

33016540|t|Patterns and predictors of mortality and disease progression among patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
33016540|a|BACKGROUND: Factors associated with mortality and disease progression in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are poorly understood. AIMS: To assess the impact of liver disease severity, demographics and comorbidities on all-cause mortality and liver disease progression in a large, real-world cohort of NAFLD patients. METHODS: Claims data from the German Institut fur angewandte Gesundheitsforschung database between 2011 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Adult patients diagnosed with NAFLD and/or NASH were categorised as NAFLD, NAFLD non-progressors, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The longitudinal probability of mortality and incidence of progression were calculated for disease severity cohorts and multivariable analyses performed for adjusted mortality. RESULTS: Among 4 580 434 patients in the database, prevalence of NAFLD was 4.7% (n = 215 655). Of those, 36.8% were non-progressors, 0.2% compensated cirrhosis, 9.6% decompensated cirrhosis, 0.0005% liver transplant and 0.2% HCC. Comorbidity rates were significantly higher in compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC compared with non-progressors. The longitudinal probability of mortality for non-progressors, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC was 3.6%, 18.7%, 28.8% and 68%, respectively. Independent predictors of mortality included cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity and renal impairment. The cumulative incidence of progression in NAFLD and compensated cirrhosis patients was 10.7% and 16.7%, respectively, over 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: NAFLD patients were severely under-diagnosed and had a high probability of mortality that increased with disease progression. Early identification and effective management to halt or reverse fibrosis are essential to prevent progression.

33016563|t|High-grade serous peritoneal cancer follows a high stromal response signature and shows worse outcome than ovarian cancer.
33016563|a|In the era of personalized medicine, where transition from organ-based to individualized genetic diagnosis takes place, the tailoring of treatment in cancer becomes increasingly important. This is particularly true for high grade, advanced FIGO stage serous adenocarcinomas of the ovary (OC), fallopian tube (TC) and peritoneum (PC), which are currently all treated identically. We analysed three independent patient cohorts using histopathologically classified diagnosis and various molecular approaches (transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, next-generation sequencing, fluorescent and chromogenic in situ hybridization). Using multivariate Cox regression model, we found that PC is more aggressive compared to advanced stage OC independent of residual disease as shown by an earlier relapse-free survival in two large cohorts (HR 2.63, CI 1.59-4.37, p<0.001 and HR 1.66, CI 1.04-2.63, p<0.033). In line with these findings, transcriptomic data revealed differentially expressed gene signatures identifying PC as high stromal response tumors. The third independent cohort (n=4054) showed a distinction between these cancer types for markers suggested to be predictive for chemotherapy drug response. Our findings add additional evidence that ovarian and peritoneal cancers are epidemiologically and molecularly distinct diseases. Moreover, our data also suggest consideration of the tumor-sampling site for future diagnosis and treatment decisions.

33016574|t|Prevalence of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and age-stratified trends in clinical characteristics and treatment, based on the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan.
33016574|a|AIM: To estimate the prevalence and age-stratified treatment trends and clinical characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Japan. METHOD: Using 7 RA definitions, the prevalence of RA in those aged >=16 years was estimated using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan in the fiscal year 2017. We analyzed age-stratified trends in characteristics and treatments. RESULTS: Of 1 116 122 patients aged >=16 years with at least 1 RA-related International Classification of Diseases-10 code, 825.7 thousand patients (women, 76.3%) were assessed as having RA with an estimated prevalence of 0.65%. The highest age-stratified prevalence was 1.63% in patients aged 70-79 years. Overall, 60.8% and 7.0% of patients with RA were aged >=65 years and >=85 years, respectively. Methotrexate use was most frequent in patients aged 50-59 years (73.0%) and least frequent in patients aged >=85 years (38.2%).

33016647|t|Molecular and immunological associations of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase in metastatic melanoma patients: A fresh look at an old biomarker.
33016647|a|Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (sLDH) is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma (MM). It is currently unknown if sLDH elevation correlates with distinct molecular, metabolic, or immune features of melanoma metastases. The identification of such features may identify rational therapeutic strategies for patients with elevated sLDH. Thus, we obtained sLDH levels for melanoma patients with metastases who had undergone molecular and/or immune profiling. Our analysis of multi-omics data from independent cohorts of melanoma metastases showed that elevated sLDH was not significantly associated with differences in immune cell infiltrate, point mutations, DNA copy number variations, promoter methylation, RNA expression, or protein expression in melanoma metastases. The only significant association observed for elevated sLDH was with the number of metastatic sites of disease. Our data support that sLDH correlates with disease burden, but not specific molecular or immunological phenotypes, in metastatic melanoma.

33016778|t|Allele Frequency of ACE2 Intron Variants and Its Association with Blood Pressure.
33016778|a|Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the counter-regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, it cleaves angiotensin II to render Ag 1-7, a potent vasodilator with multiple roles in cardiovascular protection. A few studies have pinpointed ACE2 polymorphisms and their relationship with heart function and hypertension in a sex-dependent manner. These observations still lack replication mostly for admixed populations. This study aimed to report minor allele frequencies of four ACE2 intron variants, rs2285666, rs2048683, rs2106809, and rs4240157, derived from previous research using the GSA, v1.0, microarray in 1231 hypertensive and nonhypertensive patients. Logistic and multiple linear regression models were developed to identify potential associations with hypertension status and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP). Allele frequency differences were identified for ACE2 rs2048683 and rs4240157 in populations with European ancestry and people of the Americas. Regression analyses identified a significant association of ACE2 rs2048683 and rs4240157 with SBP/DBP in males or females. Our observations confirm sex differences in ACE2 genetic associations with SBP and DBP and contribute to the collection of genetic variation in ACE2 for admixed populations.

33016797|t|Risk factors of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates with sepsis: A retrospective case-control study.
33016797|a|Sepsis, a severe infectious disease in the neonatal period, is considered a risk factor for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). To investigate the specific risk factors for NEC in septic infants, septic infants admitted to our center from January 2010 to April 2018 were included. Septic neonates with proven NEC (Bell's stage >=II) were enrolled in the NEC group, and those without NEC were enrolled in the control group. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and risk factors were compared between the two groups. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the potential risk factors for NEC. A total of 610 septic neonates were included, of whom 78 (12.8%) had complicated NEC. The univariate analysis indicated that infants with NEC had a lower birth weight, a lower gestational age, and older age on admission than those without NEC (P < 0.05). Higher rates of anemia, prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) (>=18 h), pregnancy-induced hypertension, late-onset sepsis (LOS), red blood cell transfusion and hypoalbuminemia were observed in the NEC group than in the non-NEC group (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed LOS (P = 0.000), red blood cell transfusion (P = 0.001) and hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.001) were associated with the development of NEC. Among NEC infants, those who needed red blood cell transfusion had a longer hospitalization duration than those who did not need transfusion (P < 0.05). LOS, red blood cell transfusion and hypoalbuminemia were independent risk factors for the development of NEC in infants with sepsis. Taking measures to reduce the occurrence of hypoproteinemia and severe anemia may help to reduce the occurrence of NEC in septic neonates.

33016800|t|Clinical Tolerability and Safety of Tramadol in Hospitalized Patients.
33016800|a|Tramadol is a schedule IV, monoaminergic and mu-opioid-receptor analgesic with unique pharmacology properties. Though it is well established and widely utilized, there is little guidance on tramadol's place in therapy, including tolerability, safety and monitoring guidelines. Retrospective chart review of 250 patients who received oral tramadol during their hospitalization from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. Of the 250 patients, 10.8% had cancer as their primary diagnosis while 8.8% were admitted for hematologic reasons. 79.1% of patients had acute pain. Palliative care consult or ICU admission resulted in significant discontinuation of tramadol (p < 0.05 odds ratio 6.88, 2.39). There was no significant relationship of hypoglycemia when evaluating days on tramadol, total number of doses on tramadol, and MEDD start and end (p = 0.36, 0.88, 0.15, 0.23 consecutively). The longer that patients were on tramadol and the more doses they received during their inpatient stay, the greater risk of a severe drug-drug interaction (p < 0.05; R 0.29). In hospitalized patients, the risk of major and severe drug-drug interactions with tramadol increased with dose and duration. Hospital medicine, bone marrow transplant, and emergency medicine teams predominantly used tramadol.

33016812|t|Utility of Treponemal Testing from Aqueous Fluid in the Diagnosis of Ocular Syphilis in Patients with HIV/AIDS.
33016812|a|Purpose: Ocular syphilis is re-emerging globally especially in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Atypical manifestations of ocular syphilis and/or other associated opportunistic infections often lead to a diagnostic dilemma. We evaluated the utility of aqueous humor (AH) Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) titers in the diagnosis of ocular syphilis. Methods: Retrospective case series of five HIV positive patients with positive syphilis serology in whom AH sampling was performed. All patients had ocular manifestations suspicious of infectious etiology. Results: Panuveitis with/without retinitis was the commonest presentation. Along with blood investigations, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing from AH was done for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Toxoplasma gondii. In addition, serum antibody titers for Toxoplasma, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and TPHA tests for syphilis were done. In patients with raised serum RPR/TPHA, aqueous TPHA titers were also assessed. Mean serum RPR titer was >= 1:32 and TPHA titer was >=1:1280. Aqueous humor titers of TPHA was high in all patients (range >= 1:320 to >=1:5120). Aqueous PCR was negative for all other infectious etiologies in four patients. In one patient, PCR-CMV was also positive, suggestive of a dual infection. Post-treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and appropriate anti-syphilitic regime, complete resolution of lesions with corresponding fall in the serum RPR/TPHA titers were noted in all patients. Conclusions: Ocular syphilis with atypical presentations is usually diagnosed based on a positive syphilis serology and by excluding other infectious causes. In the present study, we have shown an excellent correlation between raised AH TPHA titers with serological values and the clinical presentation. Considering the ease of collection of AH in contrast to vitreous fluids, the AH-TPHA assay could potentially be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of ocular syphilis.

33016835|t|Fatal food-induced anaphylaxis: Determination of tryptase and specific IgE on cadaveric blood samples. What else for a better methodological standard?
33016835|a|Post-mortem investigation in cases of fatal anaphylaxis is required to provide clarifications on the presence of macroscopic pathological changes, histological features, and immunohistochemical positivity suggestive of the diagnosis, on biochemical evidence of anaphylaxis and on the presence of serological data indicative of the allergen responsible for the anaphylactic reaction. We describe the case of a 16-year-old boy with a medical history of allergic asthma, celiac disease, and known food-induced allergy for fish, fresh milk, peanuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, apples, kiwis, and peaches. Acute onset of dyspnea followed by cyanosis of the lips and respiratory failure was described immediately after having an ice cream sandwich. Unsuccessful rescues were immediately attempted with oral administration of betamethasone, intramuscular injection of adrenaline, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A complete post-mortem examination was performed. Serum dosage of mast cell beta-tryptase from femoral blood detecting serum values of 41.4 mg/l. Determination of specific IgE on cadaveric blood samples confirmed the anamnestic data related to sensitization for several food allergens, including cod parvalbumin, tropomyosin, brazil nut, omega-5-gliadin of foods derived from wheat and gluten. The cause of death was identified in a cardiorespiratory failure due to anaphylactic shock in a poly-allergic subject and anaphylaxis was ascribed to the wheat contained in the ice cream sandwich eaten immediately before the onset of respiratory symptoms. The need is to implement an interdisciplinary approach capable to ascertain the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests currently in use as well as to evaluate the possibility of introducing new biomarkers in practice.

33016837|t|A Retrospective Study Comparing Different Injection Approaches of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid in Patients with Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer.
33016837|a|Background: 5-aminolevulinic acid through a needle-free, plum-blossom needle or conventional needle followed by photodynamic therapy are available options for non-melanoma skin cancer treatment.Aim: To compare these three techniques of injection of 5-aminolevulinic, regarding treatment response and adverse effects in patients with non-melanoma skin cancer.Patients and Methods: Non-melanoma skin cancer patients have received six cycles of 0.5 mL intralesional 20% w/v 5-aminolevulinic acid through a conventional needle (CPT cohort, n = 158), or plum-blossom needle (BPT cohort, n = 118), or needle-free injection (NPT cohort, n = 105) followed by irradiation with a red light. Data regarding treatment response and adverse effects were collected and analyzed.Results: The treatment response was higher among patients of NPT cohort than those of CPT (p = 0.012, q = 3.981) and BPT (p = 0.012, q = 3.472) cohorts. Conventional and plum-blossom needle injections therapies were reported scar, local redness, and worse cosmetic appearance in the follow-up period.Conclusions: Needle-free injection of intralesional 5-aminolevulinic acid followed by irradiation with red light therapy were reported high treatment response with manageable adverse effects for non-melanoma skin cancer patients than that of conventional and plum-blossom needle injections.Level of Evidence: III.

33016869|t|Effect of lesion diameter and prostate volume on prostate cancer detection rate of magnetic resonance imaging: Transrectal-ultrasonography-guided fusion biopsies using cognitive targeting.
33016869|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of prostate volume and lesion size on the clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection rates of transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsies, performed by a cognitive targeting method for sampling peripheral zone lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 219 consecutive patients, who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with a 3-T scanner and had peripheral zone lesions suspected for prostate cancer. All of these patients underwent combined cognitive targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions and TRUS-guided systematic biopsy. The detection rates of csPCa according to different lesion diameters (<5 mm, 5-9.9 mm, and >=10 mm) and prostate volumes (<30 mL, 30-49.9 mL, 50-79.9 mL, and >=80 mL) were calculated per lesion basis. In addition, subgroup analysis of csPCa detection rates was performed according to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System scores of lesions. RESULTS: The csPCa detection rates according to lesion diameters <5 mm, 5-9.9 mm, and >=10 mm were 4%, 9.8%, and 33.1%, respectively, and were significantly lower for lesions <10 mm (p<0.001). The csPCa detection rates were 61.5%, 24.1%, 16.2%, and 6.9%, respectively, for prostate volumes <30 mL, 30-49.9 mL, 50-79.9 mL, and >=80 mL, and were significantly higher for prostate volumes <30 mL (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be very careful when they prefer cognitive targeted prostatic biopsy in patients with periferal zone lesions less than 10 mm and with prostate volumes greater than 30 mL, because of significantly low csPCa detection rates.

33016871|t|Role of pre-biopsy multiparametric MRI in prostate cancer diagnosis: Evidence from the literature.
33016871|a|As the conventional workup for diagnosing prostate cancer, transrectal systematic biopsy carries the risk of sepsis and overdiagnosis of insignificant prostate cancer. In recent years, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has revolutionized the diagnostic approach to prostate cancer. With widespread use of the prostate imaging and data system (PIRADS), MRI reporting has been more standardized. Several landmark papers have indicated that mpMRI in combination with targeted or combined biopsy can confidently diagnose more clinically significant prostate cancer while reducing diagnoses of insignificant disease. In this review, we aim to discuss the advantages of pre-biopsy MRI based on the current literature and to address its reliability in ruling out prostate cancer, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness.

33016872|t|Perineoscopic vesicourethral reconstruction: A novel surgical technique for anastomotic stricture following radical prostatectomy.
33016872|a|OBJECTIVE: Vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis (VUAS) is frequently seen after prostate surgery because of various operative and postoperative factors. In this study, we aimed to present our results of perineoscopic bladder neck reconstruction, which is a new technique of the perineal approach in the treatment of patients with VUAS after prostate cancer surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen consecutive patients who underwent perineoscopic bladder neck reconstruction in our clinic between July 2017 and March 2019 were included in the study. Demographic characteristics, surgical history, postoperative continence status, and additional treatment requirements were recorded. Perineoscopic surgery is defined as the visualization of the surgical site with instruments used in laparoscopy and the surgeon performing the entire operative procedure through the screen. RESULTS: The mean number of preoperative endoscopic bladder neck resections of the patients was 7+-5.1, with a history of suprapubic cystostomy in 7 (43.7%) and radiotherapy in 5 (31.2%) patients before surgery. The mean surgical time was 126.2+-13.1 min. The mean follow-up period was 13.2+-6.8 months, and the success rate was 81.25%. During follow-up, two (12.5%) patients received perineoscopic re-do reconstruction because of stricture recurrence, and one (6.2%) patient was included in a urethral dilatation program. CONCLUSION: Improving visualization and ergonomics with the perineoscopic approach can increase the success rate of bladder neck reconstruction in comparison with the standard approach. In addition, the lack of need for expanded dissection (corporal separation, inferior pubectomy) reduces postoperative complication rates.

33016900|t|LncRNA testis-specific transcript, Y-linked 15 (TTTY15) promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells via regulating miR-29a-3p/DVL3 axis.
33016900|a|BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNA testis-specific transcript, Y-linked 15 (TTTY15) is oncogenic in prostate cancer, however its expression and function in colorectal cancer remain largely unknown. METHODS: Paired colorectal cancer samples/adjacent tissues were collected, and the expression levels of TTTY15, miR-29a-3p and disheveled segment polarity protein 3 (DVL3) were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); TTTY15 shRNA and overexpression plasmids were transfected into HT29 and HCT-116 cell lines using lipofectamine reagent, respectively; the proliferation and colony formation were detected by CCK-8 assay and plate colony formation assay; qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the changes of miR-29a-3p and DVL3; dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to determine the regulatory relationships between miR-29a-3p and TTTY15, miR-29a-3p and DVL3. RESULTS: TTTY15 was significantly up-regulated in cancerous tissues of colorectal cancer samples, positively correlated with the expression of DVL3, while negatively correlated with the expression of miR-29a-3p. After TTTY15 shRNAs were transfected into colorectal cancer cells, the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells were significantly inhibited, while TTTY15 overexpression had opposite biological effects. TTTY15 shRNA could reduce the expression of DVL3 on both mRNA and protein levels, and the luciferase activity of TTTY15 sequence was also inhibited by miR-29a-3p. DVL3 was also validated as a target gene of miR-29a-3p, and it could be repressed by miR-29a-3p mimics or TTTY15 shRNA. CONCLUSION: TTTY15 is abnormally upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues, and it can modulate the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells. It functions as the ceRNA to regulate the expression of DVL3 by sponging miR-29a-3p.

33016905|t|Subcutaneous Administration of AMD3100 into Mice Models of Alzheimer's Disease Ameliorated Cognitive Impairment, Reduced Neuroinflammation, and Improved Pathophysiological Markers.
33016905|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the prevalent dementia in the elderly, involves many related and interdependent pathologies that manifest simultaneously, leading to cognitive impairment and death. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain triggers the onset of AD, accompanied by neuroinflammatory response and pathological changes. The CXCR4/CXCL12 (SDF1) axis is one of the major signal transduction cascades involved in the inflammation process and regulation of homing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the bone marrow niche. Inhibition of the axis with AMD3100, a reversible antagonist of CXCR4 mobilizes endogenous HSCs from the bone marrow into the periphery, facilitating the recruitment of bone marrow-derived microglia-like cells into the brain, attenuates the neuroinflammation process that involves release of excitotoxic markers such as TNFalpha, intracellular Ca2 +, and glutamate and upregulates monocarboxylate transporter 1, the major L-lactate transporter in the brain. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we investigate if administration of a combination of AMD3100 and L-lactate may have beneficial effects in the treatment of AD. METHODS: We tested the feasibility of the combined treatment for short- and long-term efficacy for inducing endogenous stem cells' mobilization and attenuation of neuroinflammation in two distinct amyloid-beta-induced AD mouse models. RESULTS: The combined treatment did not demonstrate any adverse effects on the mice, and resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive/memory functions, attenuated neuroinflammation, and alleviated AD pathologies compared to each treatment alone. CONCLUSION: This study showed AMD3100's beneficial effect in ameliorating AD pathogenesis, suggesting an alternative to the multistep procedures of transplantation of stem cells in the treatment of AD.

33016917|t|Incidence of Dementia and Associated Factors in the EPIC-Spain Dementia Cohort.
33016917|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia has become a public health priority as the number of cases continues to grow worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To assess dementia incidence and determinants in the EPIC-Spain Dementia Cohort. METHODS: 25,015 participants (57% women) were recruited from three Spanish regions between 1992-1996 and followed-up for over 20 years. Incident cases were ascertained through individual revision of medical records of potential cases. Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates (IR) of dementia and sub-types (Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-AD) were calculated by sex. Neelson-Aalen cumulative incidence estimates at 10, 15, and 20 years were obtained for each sex and age group. Multivariate Royston-Parmar models were used to assess independent determinants. RESULTS: Global IR were higher in women for dementia and AD, and similar by sex for non-AD. IR ranged from 0.09 cases of dementia (95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.13) and 0.05 [0.03-0.09] of AD per 1000 person-years (py) in participants below 60 years, to 23.2 (15.9-33.8) cases of dementia and 14.6 (9.1-33.5) of AD (per 1000 py) in those >=85 years. Adjusted IR were consistently higher in women than men for overall dementia and AD. Up to 12.5% of women and 9.1% of men 60-65 years-old developed dementia within 20 years. Low education, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were the main independent predictors of dementia risk, whereas alcohol showed an inverse association. CONCLUSION: Dementia incidence increased with age and was higher among women, but showed no geographical pattern. Dementia risk was higher among subjects with lower education, not drinking alcohol, and presenting cardiovascular risk factors.

33016918|t|Pre-Analytical Sampling and Storage Conditions of Amyloid-beta Peptides in Venous and Capillary Blood.
33016918|a|Previous studies on blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease suggest a less invasive blood test might be a valuable screening tool for Alzheimer-specific pathology. Pre-analytical sample storage conditions seem to play an important role on amyloid-beta (Abeta) stability, impacting reliability and reproducibility. This study shows that Abeta40, Abeta42, and Abeta42/40 levels significantly and early decrease during storage at room temperature in whole blood or plasma. Storing blood samples at 4 C leads to stable Abeta peptide concentrations up to 72 h. In addition, Abeta peptides can be measured in capillary blood with a stable Abeta42/40 ratio up to 72 h at 4 C.

33016927|t|Epigenetic modulator inhibition overcomes temozolomide chemoresistance and antagonizes tumor recurrence of glioblastoma.
33016927|a|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) heterogeneity causes a greater number of deaths than any other brain tumor, despite the availability of alkylating chemotherapy. GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) contribute to GBM complexity and chemoresistance, but it remains challenging to identify and target GSCs or factors that control their activity. Here, we identified a specific GSC subset and show that activity of these cells is positively regulated by stabilization of methyl CpG binding domain 3 (MBD3) protein. MBD3 binds to CK1A and to BTRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, triggering MBD3 degradation, suggesting that modulating this circuit could antagonize GBM recurrence. Accordingly, xenograft mice treated with the CK1A activator pyrvinium pamoate (Pyr-Pam) showed enhanced MBD3 degradation in cells expressing high levels of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and in GSCs, overcoming temozolomide chemoresistance. Pyr-Pam blocked recruitment of MBD3 and the repressive nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex to neurogenesis-associated gene loci and increased acetyl-histone H3 activity and GSC differentiation. We conclude that CK1A/BTRCP/MBD3/NuRD signaling modulates GSC activation and malignancy, and that targeting this signaling could suppress GSC proliferation and GBM recurrence.

33016928|t|Multiomic analysis and immunoprofiling reveal distinct subtypes of human angiosarcoma.
33016928|a|Angiosarcomas are rare, clinically aggressive tumors with limited treatment options and a dismal prognosis. We analyzed angiosarcomas from 68 patients, integrating information from multiomic sequencing, NanoString immuno-oncology profiling, and multiplex immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Through whole-genome sequencing (n = 18), 50% of the cutaneous head and neck angiosarcomas exhibited higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) and UV mutational signatures; others were mutationally quiet and non-UV driven. NanoString profiling revealed 3 distinct patient clusters represented by lack (clusters 1 and 2) or enrichment (cluster 3) of immune-related signaling and immune cells. Neutrophils (CD15+), macrophages (CD68+), cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), Tregs (FOXP3+), and PD-L1+ cells were enriched in cluster 3 relative to clusters 2 and 1. Likewise, tumor inflammation signature (TIS) scores were highest in cluster 3 (7.54 vs. 6.71 vs. 5.75, respectively; P < 0.0001). Head and neck angiosarcomas were predominant in clusters 1 and 3, providing the rationale for checkpoint immunotherapy, especially in the latter subgroup with both high TMB and TIS scores. Cluster 2 was enriched for secondary angiosarcomas and exhibited higher expression of DNMT1, BRD3/4, MYC, HRAS, and PDGFRB, in keeping with the upregulation of epigenetic and oncogenic signaling pathways amenable to targeted therapies. Molecular and immunological dissection of angiosarcomas may provide insights into opportunities for precision medicine.

33016992|t|From oxygen sensing to angiogenesis: Targeting the hypoxia signaling pathway in metastatic kidney cancer.
33016992|a|PURPOSE: This article summarizes examples of current and emerging therapies that target the hypoxia and angiogenesis signaling pathways in the clear cell type of renal cell cancer (RCC), with an emphasis on the hypoxia signaling pathway. SUMMARY: Mammalian cells transduce signals of decreased oxygen to hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), an intracellular heterodimer that mediates the adaptation of normal and tumor cells to oxygen deprivation. HIF is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells and is involved in the transcriptional activation of many genes essential for cell invasion, migration, survival, and angiogenesis (including vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]). Moreover, HIF confers resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Blocking the activity of HIF inhibits the expression of VEGF and oncogenic pathways, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth. Interestingly, activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (eg, the gene encoding von Hippel-Lindau [VHL] tumor suppressor protein) can activate tumorigenesis even with normal levels of oxygen, providing support for the notion that the HIF-VHL-VEGF axis is amenable to targeted therapies for the treatment of RCC. This article highlights the current understanding of the hypoxia signaling pathway and its relevance to RCC development. Pharmacologic agents targeting the hypoxia and angiogenesis signaling pathways are discussed. CONCLUSION: Development of novel therapeutic agents that target the hypoxia and angiogenesis signaling pathways holds promise in the management of metastatic clear cell RCC.

33017014|t|A multicenter non-randomized phase III study of sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer.
33017014|a|This prospective multicenter non-randomized phase III study aims to evaluate the long-term outcome of sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer compared with conventional distal or total gastrectomy. Clinically diagnosed primary T1N0M0 gastric cancer patients with a single lesion (<=40 mm) and without previous endoscopic treatment will be enrolled in this study. Sentinel nodes are identified by dye and radioisotope tracers and are subjected to intraoperative rapid pathology. For patients with negative sentinel node metastasis, individualized surgery consisting of limited stomach resection and sentinel node basin dissection is performed, while standard gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection is employed for the positive sentinel node patients. A total of 225 patients will be accrued from 13 hospitals that have experience in sentinel node mapping. The primary endpoint is 5-year relapse-free survival. The secondary endpoints are overall survival, sentinel node detection rate, diagnostic accuracy for sentinel node, distribution of sentinel nodes and metastatic sentinel node/non-sentinel node, and postoperative quality of life.

33017025|t|Computational Drug Repositioning Identifies Potentially Active Therapies for Chordoma.
33017025|a|BACKGROUND: Chordomas are aggressive bone tumors that often recur despite maximal resection and adjuvant radiation. To date there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved chemotherapies. Computational drug repositioning is an expanding approach to identify pharmacotherapies for clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To identify FDA-approved compounds for repurposing in chordoma. METHODS: Previously identified highly differentially expressed genes from chordoma tissue samples at our institution were compared with pharmacogenomic interactions in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) using ksRepo, a drug-repositioning platform. Compounds selected by ksRepo were then validated in CH22 and UM-Chor1 human chordoma cells in Vitro. RESULTS: A total of 13 chemical compounds were identified in silico from the CTD, and 6 were selected for preclinical validation in human chordoma cell lines based on their clinical relevance. Of these, 3 identified drugs are FDA-approved chemotherapies for other malignancies (cisplatin, cytarabine, and lucanthone). Cytarabine, a deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase inhibitor approved for the treatment of various leukemias, exhibited a significant concentration-dependent effect against CH22 and UM-Chor1 cells when compared to positive (THZ1) and negative (venetoclax) controls. Tretinoin exhibited a significant concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect in CH22, sacral chordoma-derived cell lines but to a much lesser extent in UM-Chor1, a cell line derived from skull base chordoma. CONCLUSION: Cytarabine administration reduces the viability of human chordoma cells. The equally effective reduction in viability seen with tretinoin seems to be cell line dependent. Based on our findings, we recommend the evaluation of cytarabine and tretinoin in an expanded set of human chordoma cell lines and animal models.

33017027|t|Prediction of Overall Survival Among Female Patients With Breast Cancer Using a Prognostic Signature Based on 8 DNA Repair-Related Genes.
33017027|a|Importance: Breast cancer (BC), a common malignant tumor, ranks first among cancers in terms of morbidity and mortality among female patients. Currently, identifying effective prognostic models has a significant association with the prediction of the overall survival of patients with BC and guidance of clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment. Objectives: To identify a potential DNA repair-related prognostic signature through a comprehensive evaluation and to further improve the accuracy of prediction of the overall survival of patients with BC. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prognostic study, conducted from October 9, 2019, to February 3, 2020, the gene expression profiles and clinical data of patients with BC were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. This study consisted of a training set from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and 2 validation cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which included 1096 patients with BC. A prognostic signature based on 8 DNA repair-related genes (DRGs) was developed to predict overall survival among female patients with BC. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary screening prognostic biomarkers were analyzed using univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox proportional hazards regression. A risk model was completely established through multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Finally, a prognostic nomogram, combining the DRG signature and clinical characteristics of patients, was constructed. To examine the potential mechanisms of the DRGs, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed. Results: In this prognostic study based on samples from 1096 women with BC (mean [SD] age, 59.6 [13.1] years), 8 DRGs (MDC1, RPA3, MED17, DDB2, SFPQ, XRCC4, CYP19A1, and PARP3) were identified as prognostic biomarkers. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that the 8-gene signature had a good predictive accuracy. In the training cohort, the areas under the curve were 0.708 for 3-year survival and 0.704 for 5-year survival. In the validation cohort, the areas under the curve were 0.717 for 3-year survival and 0.772 for 5-year survival in the GSE9893 data set and 0.691 for 3-year survival and 0.718 for 5-year survival in the GSE42568 data set. This DRG signature mainly involved some regulation pathways of vascular endothelial cell proliferation. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a prognostic signature using 8 DRGs was developed that successfully predicted overall survival among female patients with BC. This risk model provides new clinical evidence for the diagnostic accuracy and targeted treatment of BC.

33017043|t|Prevalence of antimitochondrial antibodies in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
33017043|a|BACKGROUND: In approximately 13% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, a hallmark of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) can be detected: antimitochondrial M2 antibodies (AMA-M2). It has not been determined if the presence of AMA-M2 in SLE patients results in a higher risk of PBC in comparison to those with AMA but no SLE. Until now, there have been no such analyses among individuals with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). METHODS: To assess the seropositivity rates for AMA-M2 and autoantibodies associated with autoimmune hepatitis in patients with newly diagnosed SCLE and to determine the coexistence and risk of development of autoimmune liver disease in these patients within 1 year of follow-up, data from 33 patients with newly diagnosed SCLE were analyzed. RESULTS: AMA-M2 was found in 20% of SCLE patients. Patients from the AMA-M2-positive group were characterized by significantly higher levels of cholestatic liver enzymes when compared to those without AMA-M2 (P < 0.05). After introducing therapy with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, the levels of hepatocellular enzymes increased significantly only in AMA-M2 positive patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of AMA-M2 was found in patients with SCLE. Patients with SCLE and AMA-M2 had significantly higher values of cholestatic enzymes than patients without AMA. Newly diagnosed patients with SCLE should be screened for the presence of AMA and should be clinically followed up. Avoiding drugs with potential liver toxicity should be recommended in patients with SCLE and AMA.

The goals of this review are to assess the state of the science regarding toxicological effects of PFAS, and to develop strategies for advancing knowledge on the health effects of this large family of chemicals. Currently, much of the toxicity data available for PFAS are for a handful of chemicals, primarily legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between exposure to specific PFAS and a variety of health effects, including altered immune and thyroid function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, and cancer. Concordance with experimental animal data exists for many of these effects. However, information on modes of action and adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound differences in PFAS toxicokinetic properties must be considered in understanding differences in responses between sexes and among species and life stages. With many health effects noted for a relative few example compounds, and hundreds of other PFAS in commerce lacking toxicity data, more contemporary and high throughput approaches such as read across, molecular dynamics, and protein modeling are proposed to accelerate the development of toxicity information on emerging and legacy PFAS, individually and as mixtures. Additionally, an appropriate degree of precaution, given what is already known from the PFAS examples noted here, may be needed to protect human health. This article is protected by copyright.

33017066|t|Prevalence and impact of bladder and bowel disorders in women with breast cancer: A systematic review with meta-analysis.
33017066|a|BACKGROUND: One of the consequences of breast cancer treatments may be the onset of new, or aggravation of preexisting bladder and bowel disorders. However, the presence and impact of these disorders in women with breast cancer are poorly documented. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the prevalence, incidence and impact of bladder and bowel disorders in women undergoing breast cancer treatment. METHODS: A systematic search of six databases was conducted. Pooled prevalence rates and impact of bladder and bowel disorders were calculated using random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 17 studies were included in the meta-analyses. The pooled estimate of women who experienced bladder disorders following sensitivity analysis, which removed one study reporting a result that deviated from the pooled estimate, was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32%-44%; I2  = 98%; n = 4584). The impact of bladder and bowel disorders on women's daily lives was relatively low (bladder [scale: 0-4]: mean: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.4-1.1; I2  = 99%; n = 4908; bowel [scale: 0-100]: mean 14.2; 95% CI: 9.4-19; I2  = 95%; n = 1024). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to comprehensively document the magnitude of bladder and bowel disorders in the breast cancer population. This meta-analysis found that women with breast cancer had a higher prevalence of urinary incontinence (38%) compared to women without breast cancer (21%). Given the extent and impact of our findings, screening and management of bladder and bowel disorders may be indicated in women with breast cancer to improve their health-related quality of life.

33017079|t|CD319 (SLAMF7) an alternative marker for detecting plasma cells in the presence of daratumumab or elotuzumab.
33017079|a|BACKGROUND: Daratumumab is an anti-CD38 immunotherapeutic drug that has increasingly been used to treat patients with heavily pre-treated and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. In so doing, the detection of CD38 antigen on plasma cells by flow cytometry is impeded. We hypothesized that alternative markers can be used in place or in addition to CD38 when detecting plasma cells post-treated with daratumumab. METHODS: A total of 16 alternative markers were tested using 22 bone marrow aspirates from patients with plasma cell neoplasm. The ability of selected markers to discern plasma cells from other hematopoietic cells were evaluated. The stability of tested markers when stored at 4 or 25 C after T = 0, 24, 48, and 72 h was also established. Finally, selected markers were incorporated into a panel used for monitoring multiple myeloma measurable residual disease to test their utility to identify plasma cells in the presence of daratumumab and/or elotuzumab (anti-CD319) drugs. RESULTS: Out of the 16 tested markers, CD319, CD54, CD229, CD317, and p63 were expressed by >90% of the plasma cells. Only CD319, CD54, and CD229 achieved 100% detection sensitivity. Further analysis showed that CD319 was better than CD229 and CD54 at resolving plasma cells from background hematopoietic cells, with CD54 being the worst (resolution metric, mean +- SD: CD319 [2.04 +- 0.86]; CD229 [1.47 +- 0.45]; and CD54 [1.22 +- 0.60]). CD229 was expressed by >90% of T lymphocytes, whereas CD319 was expressed preferentially by the CD8+ T cells and less frequently in CD4+ T cells. Additionally, CD229 was found on >60% of B and NK cells, as well as minor subsets of monocytes and granulocytes. CD319 was expressed on most NK cells and a minor subset of B cells, granulocytes, and monocytes. Even though CD229 and CD319 were expressed by different leukocyte subsets, their expression levels were highest on plasma cells. The expression of CD138 on plasma cells was significantly lower after storage at 4 C, while the expression levels of CD38, CD229, and CD319 remained stable at 4 or 25 C. Using limiting dilution experiments, the treatment of cells with daratumumab severely impeded the detection of CD38 antigen on plasma cells, whereas elotuzumab treatment did not block detection of CD319 on plasma cells. CONCLUSIONS: CD319 is a suitable alternative to CD38 for identifying plasma cells. Our results showed that a panel used for monitoring multiple myeloma measurable residual disease could be modified by using CD319 alone or in combination with CD38 to detect PCs in daratumumab or elotuzumab treated patients.

33017084|t|miRNA profiling of primate cervicovaginal lavage and extracellular vesicles reveals miR-186-5p as a potential antiretroviral factor in macrophages.
33017084|a|Cervicovaginal secretions, or their components collected, are referred to as cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). CVL constituents have utility as biomarkers and play protective roles in wound healing and against HIV-1 infection. However, several components of cervicovaginal fluids are less well understood, such as extracellular RNAs and their carriers, for example, extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs comprise a wide array of double-leaflet membrane extracellular particles and range in diameter from 30 nm to over one micron. The aim of this study was to determine whether differentially regulated CVL microRNAs (miRNAs) might influence retrovirus replication. To this end, we characterized EVs and miRNAs of primate CVL during the menstrual cycle and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques. EVs were enriched by stepped ultracentrifugation, and miRNA profiles were assessed with a medium-throughput stem-loop/hydrolysis probe qPCR platform. Whereas hormone cycling was abnormal in infected subjects, EV concentration correlated with progesterone concentration in uninfected subjects. miRNAs were present predominantly in the EV-depleted CVL supernatant. Only a small number of CVL miRNAs changed during the menstrual cycle or SIV infection, for example, miR-186-5p, which was depleted in retroviral infection. This miRNA inhibited HIV replication in infected macrophages in vitro. In silico target prediction and pathway enrichment analyses shed light on the probable functions of miR-186-5p in hindering HIV infections via immunoregulation, T-cell regulation, disruption of viral pathways, etc. These results provide further evidence for the potential of EVs and small RNAs as biomarkers or effectors of disease processes in the reproductive tract.

33017108|t|Dermatologic Applications and Safety Considerations of Janus Kinase Inhibitors.
33017108|a|Janus kinase inhibitors, also known as JAK inhibitors or jakinibs, represent a new class of medication that have broad potential to treat dermatologic disease. Currently, the only FDA-approved dermatologic indication for this class of medications is psoriatic arthritis; however, their utility in treating other immune-mediated skin conditions including atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, alopecia areata, and systemic and cutaneous lupus is actively being investigated. Overall, these drugs appear to be well-tolerated and have a safety profile similar to that of other biologics commonly used in dermatologic practice, although an increased risk of thromboembolism has been associated. While risk of mild infection and herpes zoster appears to be increased regardless of JAK selectivity, risk of thrombosis and malignancy based on the subtype of JAK inhibition remains to be seen. Certainly, safety concerns warrant further investigation; however, early data from ongoing clinical trials offer promise for the broad utility of these medications within future dermatologic practice.
